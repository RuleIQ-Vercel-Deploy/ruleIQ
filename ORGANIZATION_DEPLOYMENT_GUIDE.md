# üè¢ ruleIQ Organization-Level Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Organization Transfer Complete!

**New Repository**: https://github.com/RuleIQ-Vercel-Deploy/ruleIQ.git
**Organization**: RuleIQ-Vercel-Deploy
**Status**: Ready for production deployment with full Neon Database integration

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Configure Doppler for Secrets Management

**üîê Using Doppler for Centralized Secrets Management**

```bash
# Run the Doppler setup script
./scripts/deploy/doppler-setup.sh

# Or manually setup Doppler:
doppler setup
# Select: RuleIQ-Vercel-Deploy organization
# Select: ruleiq project
# Select: production environment

# Verify all secrets are configured
doppler secrets

# Generate service token for GitHub Actions
doppler configs tokens create github-actions --config production --plain
```

**Add ONLY ONE Secret to GitHub Actions:**
Navigate to: https://github.com/RuleIQ-Vercel-Deploy/ruleIQ/settings/secrets/actions

```bash
DOPPLER_TOKEN: [Your Doppler service token from above]
```

**All Other Secrets Managed in Doppler:**
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel authentication token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - RuleIQ-Vercel-Deploy organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Project ID after transfer
- `DATABASE_URL` - Neon organization database URL
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secure 32+ character secret
- `SECRET_KEY` - Secure 32+ character secret
- Optional: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, `SENTRY_DSN`

### 2. Deploy Using Doppler Workflow

**Important**: The standard workflow uses GitHub secrets directly. For Doppler integration:
- **Doppler-enabled workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel-doppler.yml`
- **Standard workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml`

When using Doppler workflow:
1. Set DOPPLER_TOKEN in GitHub Actions secrets
2. Configure all other secrets in Doppler dashboard
3. Push to main branch or manually trigger via GitHub Actions

### 3. Neon Database Organization Setup

```sql
-- Use organization-level Neon database
-- Connection URL format:
postgresql://[org-user]:[password]@[org-host]/ruleiq?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true

-- Features now available:
-- ‚úÖ Connection pooling
-- ‚úÖ Database branching
-- ‚úÖ Point-in-time recovery
-- ‚úÖ Enhanced monitoring
-- ‚úÖ Team access
```

### 3. Deploy to Production

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment at:
# https://github.com/RuleIQ-Vercel-Deploy/ruleIQ/actions
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Using Vercel CLI with organization context
vercel --prod --scope ruleiq-vercel-deploy

# Or trigger manual deployment via GitHub Actions
# Go to: Actions ‚Üí Vercel Deployment ‚Üí Run workflow
```
