# Development Checkpoint - January 7, 2025

## Current State
Successfully completed **Phase 3: Data Visualization & Analytics** including:
- ✅ Dashboard charts implementation (5 chart types)
- ✅ Analytics dashboard for Alex persona
- ✅ Export functionality (CSV, JSON, TXT, PDF, Excel)
- ✅ Customizable dashboard widgets with drag-and-drop

## Next Task: Quick Actions & Productivity
Approved plan to implement:
1. **Quick Actions Panel** - Floating action button with common tasks
2. **Command Palette (Cmd+K)** - Global search and actions
3. **Bulk Operations** - Multi-select actions across all features
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Power user productivity

## Key Files to Resume Work
- Dashboard: `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Sidebar: `/components/navigation/app-sidebar.tsx`
- For Quick Actions: Create `/components/dashboard/quick-actions/`
- For Command Palette: Use existing `cmdk` package

## Libraries Already Installed
- `cmdk@1.0.4` - For command palette
- `react-grid-layout@1.5.2` - For widgets
- `recharts@2.15.0` - For charts
- `jspdf@3.0.1`, `xlsx@0.18.5` - For exports

## Environment State
- Development server typically runs on: `http://localhost:3000`
- Using pnpm as package manager
- TypeScript errors ignored in build (check manually with `pnpm tsc --noEmit`)

## Design System Reminders
- Primary: Navy (#17255A)
- Accent: Gold (#CB963E) - use sparingly
- Energy: Cyan (#34FEF7) - use very sparingly
- 8px grid system
- Inter font family

## User Personas to Consider
- **Alex**: Wants keyboard shortcuts and efficiency
- **Ben**: Needs guided actions and confirmations
- **Catherine**: Values bulk operations for compliance

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /home/omar/Documents/ruleIQ/frontend
pnpm dev
```

## Notes
- Remove `@types/jspdf` package (deprecated)
- Consider widget error boundaries implementation
- Test export functionality with large datasets
