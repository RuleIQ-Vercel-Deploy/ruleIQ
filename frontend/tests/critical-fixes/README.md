# Critical Frontend Fixes - Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests to verify that the critical frontend issues have been resolved. These tests ensure that the ruleIQ application no longer suffers from the 422 auth errors, 404 dashboard errors, hydration warnings, and React key warnings that were causing issues.

## 🎯 Issues Being Tested

### 1. OAuth2 Token Endpoint Integration (422 Errors)

- **Problem**: Authentication was failing with 422 validation errors
- **Fix**: Proper OAuth2 form data formatting for `/auth/token` endpoint
- **Tests**: `auth-oauth2-token.test.ts`

### 2. Dashboard Route Protection (404 Errors)

- **Problem**: Users getting 404 errors when accessing dashboard routes
- **Fix**: Proper AuthGuard implementation with redirect logic
- **Tests**: `auth-guard-protection.test.tsx`

### 3. Hydration Safety (SSR/Client Mismatches)

- **Problem**: Hydration warnings due to server/client state differences
- **Fix**: Proper mount state tracking and localStorage access delays
- **Tests**: `hydration-safety.test.tsx`

### 4. React Key Uniqueness (Console Warnings)

- **Problem**: Duplicate key warnings in QuestionRenderer and file components
- **Fix**: Unique key generation for all list items and fragments
- **Tests**: `react-key-uniqueness.test.tsx`

### 5. Assessment Component Issues

- **Problem**: File upload and question rendering key conflicts
- **Fix**: Stable key generation for dynamic content
- **Tests**: `assessment-components.test.tsx`

### 6. Complete E2E Authentication Flow

- **Problem**: End-to-end flow breaking with various errors
- **Fix**: Comprehensive error handling and user journey optimization
- **Tests**: `complete-auth-flow.e2e.test.ts`

## 🧪 Running the Tests

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
# Run all critical fix tests
pnpm test:critical-fixes

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:critical-fixes:watch

# Run specific test file
pnpm vitest tests/critical-fixes/auth-oauth2-token.test.ts

# Run with coverage
pnpm vitest tests/critical-fixes/ --coverage
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Run E2E critical fix tests
pnpm test:critical-fixes:e2e

# Run with headed browser
pnpm playwright test tests/critical-fixes/complete-auth-flow.e2e.test.ts --headed

# Debug mode
pnpm playwright test tests/critical-fixes/complete-auth-flow.e2e.test.ts --debug
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + E2E)
pnpm test:all

# Run only critical fixes (unit + E2E)
pnpm test:critical-fixes && pnpm test:critical-fixes:e2e
```

## 🔍 Test Structure

Each test file follows a consistent structure:

```typescript
describe('Feature Name - Critical Fix Verification', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
    // Mock dependencies
    // Reset state
  });

  describe('Specific Issue Category', () => {
    it('should verify fix for specific scenario', () => {
      // Test implementation
      // Assertions
      // Error checking
    });
  });
});
```

## 🛠️ Mock Setup

Tests use comprehensive mocking:

- **MSW** for API request/response mocking
- **Vitest mocks** for React hooks and utilities
- **Playwright** for real browser testing
- **Console spies** for warning detection

## 📊 Success Criteria

All tests must pass with:

- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ No 422 authentication errors
- ✅ No 404 dashboard routing errors
- ✅ No hydration warnings
- ✅ No React key warnings
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ Stable user experience

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

These tests are designed to:

1. Run in CI/CD pipelines
2. Block deployments if critical issues exist
3. Provide detailed failure reporting
4. Test against multiple browsers (E2E)
5. Generate coverage reports

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Add proper mocking and cleanup
4. Update this README with new coverage

### Updating Tests

1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Update mocks when APIs change
3. Keep test data realistic
4. Document any breaking changes
