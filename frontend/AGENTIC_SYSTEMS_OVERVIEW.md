# ruleIQ Agentic Systems Overview

_Generated: 2025-08-14_

## Executive Summary

ruleIQ is implementing a comprehensive **agentic transformation** to evolve from a traditional compliance tool into an intelligent, autonomous compliance partner. The system leverages multiple AI agent architectures including **IQ Agent** (GraphRAG-powered compliance orchestrator), **RAG Self-Critic** (fact-checking and validation), and **LangGraph-based workflows** for multi-agent orchestration.

## 1. Core Agentic Vision

### Philosophy: "Building Agents, Not Tools"

- **From**: Static interactions â†’ **To**: Continuous relationship building
- **From**: Task execution â†’ **To**: Goal understanding and achievement
- **From**: Reactive responses â†’ **To**: Proactive assistance
- **From**: Feature delivery â†’ **To**: Trust development

### Trust Gradient Implementation

#### Level 1: Transparent Helper (Current State)

- Shows all reasoning and confidence levels
- Asks for confirmation before actions
- Explains decisions with transparent logic

#### Level 2: Trusted Advisor (6 months)

- Makes confident suggestions based on patterns
- Learns user preferences over time
- Predicts compliance needs proactively

#### Level 3: Autonomous Partner (12 months)

- Takes initiative with high-confidence actions
- Manages workflows autonomously
- Prevents issues before they occur

## 2. IQ Agent - GraphRAG Compliance Orchestrator

### Architecture Overview

```python
IQComplianceAgent:
  - Knowledge Base: Neo4j graph with 20+ node types
  - Memory System: GraphRAG with semantic search
  - Execution Engine: CaC automations with graph updates
  - Intelligence Layer: Pattern recognition across regulations
```

### Intelligence Loop (PPALE Framework)

1. **PERCEIVE** - Query compliance posture from Neo4j
   - Active regulations and requirements
   - Control gaps and risk landscape
   - Enforcement patterns

2. **PLAN** - Risk-weighted prioritization
   - Action plans based on gaps
   - Enforcement precedent analysis
   - Cost-benefit optimization

3. **ACT** - Execute and update graph
   - Implement compliance controls
   - Gather evidence
   - Maintain audit trail

4. **LEARN** - Pattern recognition
   - Analyze enforcement actions
   - Update control effectiveness
   - Generate improvements

5. **REMEMBER** - Memory consolidation
   - Store insights in graph
   - Consolidate patterns
   - Build knowledge base

### Key Capabilities

- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing controls for regulations
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculate dynamic risk scores from patterns
- **Coverage Analysis**: Measure compliance across domains

## 3. RAG Self-Critic System

### Purpose

Ensures response accuracy, reliability, and quality through automated fact-checking and self-criticism.

### Components

#### Core Fact-Checking Engine (`services/rag_fact_checker.py`)

- Multi-source fact verification
- Cross-reference validation
- Source reliability assessment
- Response quality scoring (0-1 scale)
- Automated self-criticism
- Bias detection

#### Command Interface (`services/rag_self_critic.py`)

```bash
# Quick fact-check (2-5 seconds)
python services/rag_self_critic.py quick-check --query "..."

# Comprehensive fact-check (10-30 seconds)
python services/rag_self_critic.py fact-check --query "..."

# Self-critique analysis (15-45 seconds)
python services/rag_self_critic.py critique --query "..."
```

### Quality Thresholds

- **Production Approval**: 0.75+ overall score
- **High Stakes**: 0.85+ overall score
- **Quick Check**: Boolean reliability for real-time

### Integration Points

```python
@app.post("/rag/query-with-validation")
async def query_with_validation(query: str):
    # Get RAG response
    rag_response = await rag_system.query_documentation(query)

    # Validate response
    validation = await critic.quick_check_command(query)

    return {
        "response": rag_response.answer,
        "validated": validation["is_reliable"],
        "confidence": rag_response.confidence,
        "trust_score": validation.get("trust_score", 0.5)
    }
```

## 4. LangGraph Multi-Agent System

### Architecture: `langgraph_agent/`

#### Core Components

- **StateGraph**: Manages agent workflow state
- **PostgreSQL Checkpointer**: Persistent state storage
- **Router Node**: Intelligent routing between specialized agents
- **Specialized Nodes**:
  - Compliance Analyzer
  - Obligation Finder
  - Evidence Collector
  - Legal Reviewer

#### State Management

```python
ComplianceAgentState:
  - company_id: UUID
  - messages: List[GraphMessage]
  - current_node: str
  - next_node: str
  - confidence_score: float
  - risk_assessment: Dict
  - compliance_context: Dict
  - memory_context: Dict
```

#### Workflow Example

```python
workflow = StateGraph(ComplianceAgentState)
workflow.add_node("router", router_node)
workflow.add_node("compliance_analyzer", compliance_analyzer_node)
workflow.add_node("obligation_finder", obligation_finder_node)

workflow.set_entry_point("router")
workflow.add_edge("router", "compliance_analyzer")
workflow.add_edge("compliance_analyzer", END)
```

## 5. Memory Systems
