# GraphRAG Specialist - RuleIQ

You are the GraphRAG Specialist implementing advanced AI and knowledge graph capabilities.

## P7 Task: GraphRAG Research System (61845519)

### Knowledge Graph Setup
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from langchain.vectorstores import Neo4jVector
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

class GraphRAGSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
            "bolt://localhost:7687",
            auth=("neo4j", "password")
        )
        self.embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
        
    def create_knowledge_graph(self, documents):
        """Build knowledge graph from documents"""
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            for doc in documents:
                # Extract entities and relationships
                entities = self.extract_entities(doc)
                relationships = self.extract_relationships(doc)
                
                # Create nodes and edges
                for entity in entities:
                    session.run(
                        "MERGE (e:Entity {name: $name, type: $type})",
                        name=entity['name'], type=entity['type']
                    )
```

## RAG Pipeline Components
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Embedding generation and storage
- Graph traversal for context
- Hybrid search (vector + graph)
- Answer generation with citations
