# RuleIQ Agentic Transformation - Draft Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Trust-Based Agent Architecture — *Proposed*

### Context
RuleIQ needs to evolve from static compliance tools to intelligent agents that build user trust over time. The system must balance automation capabilities with user control and safety.

### Proposal
Implement a 4-level trust system (0-3) where agents gain capabilities as user trust increases:
- **Level 0**: Observer - Learn and ask questions only
- **Level 1**: Advisor - Make suggestions with explanations  
- **Level 2**: Collaborator - Predict and recommend actions
- **Level 3**: Autonomous - Take approved actions independently

### Pros / Cons
**Pros:**
- Gradual trust building reduces user anxiety
- Clear capability boundaries prevent overreach
- Scalable from cautious to autonomous users
- Competitive differentiation through relationship building

**Cons:**
- Complex state management across trust levels
- Potential user frustration with initial limitations
- Requires sophisticated trust progression algorithms

### Validation Plan
- **Spike**: Build trust level 0-1 prototype (Week 1)
- **Metrics**: User progression rate, trust level distribution
- **A/B Test**: Compare with traditional static interface

## ADR-002: Multi-Model AI Strategy — *Proposed*

### Context
Different compliance tasks require different AI capabilities. Cost optimization and performance require intelligent model selection based on task complexity and user trust level.

### Proposal
Implement intelligent model routing:
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Fast responses, simple queries (Trust Level 0-1)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Complex analysis, high-stakes decisions (Trust Level 2-3)
- **Local models**: Fallback for API failures, sensitive data
- **Specialized models**: Future fine-tuned compliance models

### Pros / Cons
**Pros:**
- 40-60% cost reduction through smart routing
- Better performance matching task complexity
- Resilience through fallback options
- Future-ready for specialized models

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity in model management
- Potential inconsistency across models
- Higher infrastructure requirements

### Validation Plan
- **PoC**: Implement routing logic with cost tracking
- **Metrics**: Cost per interaction, response quality scores
- **Load Test**: Validate fallback mechanisms under load

## ADR-003: RAG-Powered Self-Critic System — *Proposed*

### Context
AI responses in compliance must be accurate and trustworthy. A self-validation system can catch errors before they reach users, especially critical for autonomous actions.

### Proposal
Implement a RAG-powered self-critic that validates AI responses:
- **Knowledge Base**: Regulatory documents, compliance frameworks
- **Validation Pipeline**: Every AI response checked against knowledge base
- **Confidence Scoring**: Responses rated 0-100% confidence
- **Escalation**: Low confidence responses require human review

### Pros / Cons
**Pros:**
- Significantly improved response accuracy
- Builds user trust through transparent validation
- Reduces liability from incorrect compliance advice
- Enables higher trust levels with safety

**Cons:**
- Increased latency (100-200ms per response)
- Higher computational costs
- Complex knowledge base maintenance
- Potential over-conservative responses

### Validation Plan
- **Prototype**: Build validation pipeline with sample knowledge base
- **Metrics**: Accuracy improvement, false positive/negative rates
- **Benchmark**: Compare against human expert validation

## ADR-004: Conversational Assessment Interface — *Proposed*

### Context
Traditional form-based assessments are rigid and don't capture nuanced business contexts. Conversational interfaces can adapt questions based on responses and build better user relationships.

### Proposal
Replace static forms with conversational assessment flows:
- **Dynamic Questioning**: Follow-up questions based on previous answers
- **Context Awareness**: Remember previous sessions and business changes
- **Natural Language**: Accept free-form responses with AI interpretation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually based on user sophistication

### Pros / Cons
**Pros:**
- Better user experience and engagement
- More accurate business context capture
- Adaptive to different user types and industries
- Foundation for ongoing relationship building

**Cons:**
- Complex conversation flow management
- Potential for user confusion or frustration
- Requires sophisticated NLP capabilities
- Harder to ensure completeness

### Validation Plan
- **User Testing**: A/B test conversational vs. form-based flows
- **Metrics**: Completion rates, time to complete, user satisfaction
- **Pilot**: Deploy with select customers for feedback

## ADR-005: Event-Driven Trust Progression — *Proposed*

### Context
Trust levels must evolve based on user behavior, successful interactions, and demonstrated competence. The system needs to automatically recognize when users are ready for higher trust levels.

### Proposal
Implement event-driven trust progression system:
- **Behavior Tracking**: Monitor user interactions, acceptance rates, corrections
- **Success Metrics**: Track successful recommendations and outcomes
- **Time-Based Factors**: Consider relationship duration and consistency
- **Manual Override**: Allow users to request trust level changes

### Pros / Cons
**Pros:**
- Automatic progression reduces friction
- Data-driven decisions more reliable than manual
- Personalized progression rates
- Clear audit trail for trust decisions

**Cons:**
- Complex algorithm development and tuning
- Risk of premature or delayed progression
- Privacy concerns with behavior tracking
- Potential gaming by sophisticated users

### Validation Plan
- **Algorithm Design**: Define progression criteria and weights
- **Simulation**: Test with historical user data
- **Gradual Rollout**: Start with opt-in beta users

## ADR-006: Microservices vs. Modular Monolith — *Proposed*

### Context
The agentic transformation adds significant complexity. Architecture must balance scalability, maintainability, and operational complexity for a team transitioning from monolithic to distributed systems.

### Proposal
Start with modular monolith, evolve to selective microservices:
- **Phase 1**: Modular monolith with clear service boundaries
- **Phase 2**: Extract high-load services (AI, RAG) to separate processes
- **Phase 3**: Full microservices for independent scaling and deployment

### Pros / Cons
**Pros:**
- Reduced operational complexity initially
- Easier debugging and development
- Clear evolution path to microservices
- Lower infrastructure costs

**Cons:**
- Potential scaling limitations
- Harder to achieve independent deployments
- Risk of tight coupling without discipline
- May delay some performance optimizations

### Validation Plan
- **Load Testing**: Validate monolith can handle target load
- **Service Boundaries**: Clearly define and enforce module interfaces
- **Migration Plan**: Detailed roadmap for service extraction
