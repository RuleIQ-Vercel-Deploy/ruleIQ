## 📊 Monitoring Schedule

| Checkpoint | Time (UTC) | Action |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2-hour | 2025-01-03 04:20 | Initial progress check |
| 6-hour | 2025-01-03 08:20 | Task status verification |
| 12-hour | 2025-01-03 14:20 | Quarter-progress review |
| 24-hour | 2025-01-04 02:20 | Half-way assessment |
| 36-hour | 2025-01-04 14:20 | **ESCALATION POINT** |
| 48-hour | 2025-01-05 02:20 | **DEADLINE** |

## 🚦 Gate Enforcement

### Current Status
- **P0**: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
- **P1**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (0% - just started)
- **P2**: 🔒 BLOCKED (awaiting P1 completion)
- **P3-P7**: 🔒 BLOCKED (sequential gates)

### Strict Rules
1. **NO P2 WORK** until ALL three P1 tasks complete
2. **Parallel Execution** allowed within P1 priority
3. **48-hour hard deadline** per task
4. **Escalation at 36 hours** if behind schedule

## 📈 Velocity Metrics

- **P0 Average**: 2.7 hours per task
- **P0 Efficiency**: 67.5% time utilization
- **Current Team Size**: 4 active agents
- **Projected P1 Completion**: 2025-01-05 02:20 UTC

## ⚠️ Risk Factors

1. **CI/CD Complexity**: GitHub Actions setup may require iteration
2. **Dead Code Analysis**: Large codebase may take time to scan
3. **JWT Implementation**: Security review critical for auth routes

## 🎯 Success Criteria for P1 Gate

All three tasks must achieve:
- ✅ Implementation complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ No regression on P0 work
- ✅ Acceptance criteria met

## 📝 Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Specialists begin work on assigned tasks
2. **2 hours**: First progress check at 04:20 UTC
3. **Continuous**: Monitor for blockers or dependencies
4. **36 hours**: Prepare escalation if any task behind

**Note**: This report tracks the critical P1 execution phase. Strict gate enforcement remains in effect - no P2 work begins until P1 reaches 100% completion.
