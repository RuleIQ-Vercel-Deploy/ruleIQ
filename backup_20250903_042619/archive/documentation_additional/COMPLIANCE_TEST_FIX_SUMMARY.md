# Compliance Accuracy Test Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The AI compliance accuracy tests in `tests/ai/test_compliance_accuracy.py` were experiencing intermittent failures due to incorrect parameter passing in several test methods.

## Root Cause
The tests were passing incorrect argument types to the `assistant.process_message()` method:
- Passing string IDs (`"test-user"`, `"test-profile"`) instead of proper User objects and UUID values
- Passing raw `uuid4()` calls as user parameters instead of User fixture objects
- Missing required fixture parameters in some test methods

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `test_consistency_across_similar_questions` (Line 364-369)
Changed from:
```python
response, metadata = await assistant.process_message(
    conversation_id="test-conv",
    user_id="test-user",
    message=question_data["question"],
    business_profile_id="test-profile",
)
```

To:
```python
response, metadata = await assistant.process_message(
    conversation_id=uuid4(),
    user=async_sample_user,
    message=question_data["question"],
    business_profile_id=async_sample_business_profile.id,
)
```

### 2. Fixed `test_framework_identification_accuracy` (Line 564-568, 606-611)
- Added missing fixture parameters: `async_sample_user`, `async_sample_business_profile`
- Changed `user=uuid4()` to `user=async_sample_user`
- Changed `business_profile_id=uuid4()` to `business_profile_id=async_sample_business_profile.id`

### 3. Fixed `test_cross_framework_guidance` (Line 620-624, 653-658)
- Added missing fixture parameters: `async_sample_user`, `async_sample_business_profile`
- Changed `user=uuid4()` to `user=async_sample_user`
- Changed `business_profile_id=uuid4()` to `business_profile_id=async_sample_business_profile.id`

## Test Results
After fixes:
- All 10 tests in the file are now passing consistently
- Multiple test runs confirm stability
- No more intermittent failures observed

## Why These Fixes Work
1. **Proper Type Matching**: The `process_message` method expects a User object for the `user` parameter, not a string or UUID
2. **Fixture Dependencies**: Tests now properly declare and use the required async fixtures for user and business profile data
3. **Consistent IDs**: Using the fixture's actual IDs ensures database relationships are properly maintained during tests

## Verification
The tests were run multiple times to ensure stability:
- Initial run: 10/10 tests passed
- Subsequent runs: Consistent passes with no errors
- Average runtime: ~32-40 seconds for all 10 tests
