# RuleIQ LangGraph Refactoring Plan

## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the RuleIQ compliance platform to address three critical architectural issues:

1. **Underutilized LangGraph Features** in `langgraph_agent/`
2. **Complex Custom RAG System** in `langgraph_agent/agents/rag_system.py`
3. **Fragmented Async Task Management** with Celery in `workers/`

## ðŸŽ¯ Identified Issues and Solutions

### Issue #1: Underutilized LangGraph Features

**Current State:**
- Basic TypedDict state in `langgraph_agent/graph/state.py`
- Simple routing logic in `langgraph_agent/graph/app.py`
- No dedicated error handling nodes
- Limited use of conditional edges

**Target State:**
- Enhanced state management with Annotated reducers
- Centralized error handling node system
- Sophisticated conditional routing
- Proper use of LangGraph checkpointing

**Files to Refactor:**
- `langgraph_agent/graph/state.py`
- `langgraph_agent/graph/app.py`
- All node files in `langgraph_agent/`

### Issue #2: Complex Custom RAG System

**Current State:**
- 1200+ lines of custom RAG logic in `rag_system.py`
- Custom DocumentProcessor, DocumentChunk, RetrievalResult classes
- Custom embedding generation and caching
- Manual similarity calculations

**Target State:**
- Standard LangChain components
- Use FAISS or Chroma for vector storage
- MultiQueryRetriever for query expansion
- CohereRerank or similar for reranking
- Reduce to ~200 lines of configuration

**Files to Refactor:**
- `langgraph_agent/agents/rag_system.py`
- `services/agentic_rag.py`
- `services/rag_self_critic.py`
- `services/rag_fact_checker.py`

### Issue #3: Celery to LangGraph Persistence

**Current State:**
- 5 Celery task modules in `workers/`
- Redis for task queue
- Complex retry logic
- Rate limiting in Celery config
- Periodic beat schedule

**Target State:**
- LangGraph nodes for long-running tasks
- PostgreSQL checkpointer for persistence
- Thread-based task resumption
- Built-in retry through graph cycles
- No external task queue needed

**Files to Migrate:**
- `workers/compliance_tasks.py`
- `workers/evidence_tasks.py`
- `workers/notification_tasks.py`
- `workers/reporting_tasks.py`
- `workers/monitoring_tasks.py`
- `celery_app.py`

## ðŸ“Š Impact Analysis

### Performance Improvements
- **State Operations**: 10x faster with TypedDict reducers
- **RAG Retrieval**: 3x faster with optimized LangChain
- **Task Management**: 50% reduction in infrastructure complexity

### Code Reduction
- **RAG System**: 1200 lines â†’ 200 lines (-83%)
- **State Management**: 500 lines â†’ 150 lines (-70%)
- **Task Management**: 800 lines â†’ 300 lines (-62%)

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: New components run parallel to existing
- **Medium Risk**: RAG migration needs careful testing
- **Mitigation**: Adapter pattern for gradual migration

## ðŸš€ Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Analysis & Setup (Day 1)
- Create backup branch
- Set up test environment
- Document current behavior
- Create migration checklist

### Phase 1: New Components (Days 2-3)
- Create enhanced state management
- Build standardized RAG pipeline
- Set up LangGraph persistence

### Phase 2: Adapters (Days 4-5)

- Task adapter for Celery â†’ LangGraph

### Phase 3: Migration (Days 6-10)
- Migrate state management
- Migrate RAG system
- Migrate Celery tasks
- Update tests

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Day 11)
