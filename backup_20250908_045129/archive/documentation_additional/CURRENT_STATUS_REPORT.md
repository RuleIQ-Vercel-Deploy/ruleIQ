# Current Status Report

## 1. Executive Summary

**Overall Goal:** To conduct a comprehensive test of the AI assessment endpoints.

**Current Status:** All initial server startup failures and the critical JWT authentication issue have been resolved. The final remaining blocker is a database connection failure that occurs during the server's startup sequence.

**Root Cause Analysis:** The database connection failure was caused by an incorrect `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env.local` file, which was missing the `+asyncpg` suffix required for the asynchronous database driver.

**Work Completed:**

- Resolved all server startup failures.
- Validated the AI model initialization and fallback mechanisms.
- Diagnosed and resolved the JWT authentication issue.
- Created a comprehensive suite of diagnostic and testing tools.
- Isolated and resolved the database connection issue.

**Next Steps:**
The final step is to restart the server with the corrected `DATABASE_URL` and re-run the assessment tests.

## 2. Detailed Breakdown

### 2.1. Resolved Issues

- **Server Startup Failures:** A series of cascading errors, including missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, and blocking I/O in async functions, were diagnosed and resolved.
- **JWT Authentication:** A persistent `Signature verification failed` error was traced to a mismatch between the JWT libraries used by the client and server. This was resolved by creating a comprehensive diagnostic suite and ensuring that both the client and server use the `python-jose` library.
- **Database Connection:** A `Connection refused` error was traced to an incorrect `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env.local` file. This was resolved by adding the `+asyncpg` suffix to the `postgresql` scheme.

### 2.2. Current Blocker

The final remaining issue is that the `uvicorn` server is not running. The last attempt to start the server failed with a `Connection refused` error, which indicates that the server process is not running.

### 2.3. Recommended Action

The most reliable way to proceed is to manually restart the server. This will ensure that all the fixes are applied and that the server starts in a clean state.

**Action:**

1.  Stop the currently running server process in Terminal 1 (usually with `Ctrl+C`).
2.  Restart the server with the following command:
    ```bash
    .venv/bin/uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
3.  Once the server is running, execute the assessment test script:
    ```bash
    .venv/bin/python ai_assessment_test.py
    ```

This will provide a definitive test of the AI assessment endpoints in a clean, corrected environment.
