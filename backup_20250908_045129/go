I'll initialize your ruleIQ session with both MCP servers.

First, let me verify Serena MCP is active:
/usr/bin/python3 /home/omar/Documents/ruleIQ/.claude/serena-verification.py

Now checking Archon MCP health:
mcp__archon__health_check

Activating ruleIQ project in Serena:
mcp__serena__activate_project ruleIQ

Reading project documentation:
cat /home/omar/Documents/ruleIQ/CLAUDE.md

Checking current Archon tasks:
mcp__archon__list_tasks filter_by="status" filter_value="todo"

Your ruleIQ session is now initialized with:
✅ Serena MCP: Code intelligence active
✅ Archon MCP: Task management ready
✅ Project context loaded

Remember the golden rule: Always check Archon tasks FIRST before any coding.
