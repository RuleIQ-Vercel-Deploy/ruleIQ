# ✅ Context Refresh System Integration Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented and integrated the context refresh system with the BMad YOLO orchestrator as requested. This enables continuous work without context overflow issues.

## What Was Built

### 1. Context Refresh System (`context-refresh-system.py`)
- **Token Management**: Per-agent token limits (PM: 6k, Architect: 8k, Dev: 10k, QA: 6k)
- **Priority System**: 5-level priority (CRITICAL → ARCHIVE)
- **Smart Refresh**: Sliding window with intelligent summarization
- **Handoff Optimization**: Filters and prepares context for target agents

### 2. YOLO Integration (`yolo-system.py`)
- **Seamless Integration**: Context manager initialized with orchestrator
- **Automatic Refresh**: Context refreshed during every handoff
- **Status Reporting**: Context stats included in YOLO status
- **Fallback Safety**: Works with or without context system

### 3. Testing & Validation (`test-context-integration.py`)
- Verified integration works correctly
- Context properly managed during handoffs
- Token limits respected
- Statistics accurately reported

## Key Features Delivered

✅ **"Just the right amount of context per agent"** - Each agent has optimal token limits
✅ **"Enabling continuous work"** - Context refresh prevents overflow
✅ **Automatic Management** - No manual intervention needed
✅ **Priority-Based Retention** - Critical info never lost
✅ **Smart Summarization** - Old context condensed, not deleted

## Usage Example

```python
# YOLO automatically uses context refresh during handoffs
orchestrator = YOLOOrchestrator()
await orchestrator.activate()

# Context automatically refreshed during handoff
package = await orchestrator.handoff(
    to_agent=AgentType.DEV,
    context={"task": "Implement feature", "requirements": [...]}
)
# Dev agent receives optimized context within token limits
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No Context Overflow**: Agents never exceed token limits
2. **Continuous Operation**: Can run indefinitely without manual resets
3. **Intelligent Filtering**: Each agent gets relevant context only
4. **Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead, maximum efficiency
5. **Audit Trail**: All context decisions logged
