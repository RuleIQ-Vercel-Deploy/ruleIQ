gate_id: QA-GATE-1.2-RATE
story: "1.2: Rate Limiting Middleware Implementation"

version: 1.0

## Gate Decision
status: PASS
readiness: Ready for Development

## Risk Assessment
risk_level: HIGH
risk_factors:
  - security_impact: 9  # DDoS and abuse prevention
  - performance_impact: 7  # Adds overhead to every request
  - availability_impact: 10  # Prevents resource exhaustion

## Requirements Coverage
acceptance_criteria:
  - ac1_all_endpoints: COVERED
  - ac2_tier_limits: COVERED
  - ac3_configurable: COVERED
  - ac4_error_messages: COVERED
  - ac5_headers: COVERED
  - ac6_redis_distributed: COVERED
  - ac7_admin_bypass: COVERED
  - ac8_monitoring: COVERED

## Technical Assessment
strengths:
  - Sliding window algorithm (accurate rate limiting)
  - Tiered limits (anonymous/free/premium/enterprise)
  - Redis-backed for distributed systems
  - Admin bypass with audit logging
  - Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

concerns:
  - Burst allowance not addressed
  - IP-based vs user-based limiting unclear
  - Cost-based limiting for expensive operations not detailed
  - Rate limit configuration hot-reload not mentioned

## Non-Functional Requirements
security: STRONG
performance: GOOD
reliability: EXCELLENT
maintainability: GOOD

## Test Coverage
unit_tests: PLANNED
integration_tests: PLANNED
load_tests: PLANNED
tier_tests: PLANNED
missing_tests:
  - Concurrent request testing

## Implementation Risks
- Redis dependency creates single point of failure
- Configuration complexity with many endpoints Ã— tiers
- High-volume metrics generation overhead

## Recommendations
immediate:
  - Define fallback when Redis unavailable (fail open/closed?)
  - Add burst allowance for legitimate traffic spikes
  - Clarify IP-based vs authenticated user limiting
  - Add configuration validation on startup

future:
  - Adaptive rate limiting based on system load
  - IP reputation scoring integration
  - Cost-based limiting for expensive operations
  - Rate limit configuration hot-reload

## Dependencies
requires:
  - Story 1.1 JWT validation (for user identification)
  - Redis infrastructure
  - Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)

blocks:
  - Public API access
  - High-volume operations
  - Third-party integrations

## Implementation Notes
- Use sliding window with Redis sorted sets
- Implement connection pooling for performance
- Order in middleware stack matters (after CORS, before auth)
- Consider fail-safe defaults

## Rate Limit Tiers
anonymous: 10 req/min
authenticated: 100 req/min
premium: 1000 req/min
enterprise: 10000 req/min

special_endpoints:
  - /api/auth/login: 5 req/5min
  - /api/reports/generate: 10 req/hour

## Approval
approved: true
approved_by: Quinn (Test Architect)
approval_date: 2025-01-11
conditions:
  - Redis failure strategy must be clearly defined
  - Burst allowance mechanism should be added
  - IP vs user-based limiting must be clarified
