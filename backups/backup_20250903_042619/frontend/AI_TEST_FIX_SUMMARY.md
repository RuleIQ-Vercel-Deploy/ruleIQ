# AI Integration Tests Fix Summary

## Overview

All AI service integration tests are now passing. The fixes addressed issues with mock implementations, state persistence, and component behavior in the test environment.

## Tests Fixed

### 1. AI Service Integration Tests (`tests/ai-service-integration.test.ts`)

- ✅ All 9 tests passing
- No changes needed - tests were already passing

### 2. AI Integration Tests (`tests/ai-integration.test.ts`)

- ✅ All 7 tests passing
- Fixed localStorage mock implementation in `tests/setup.ts`
- Tests now properly persist and restore assessment state

### 3. AIHelpTooltip Tests (`tests/components/ai/AIHelpTooltip.test.tsx`)

- ✅ All 12 tests passing
- Fixed issues:
  - Updated component to fix requestId race condition
  - Updated tests to find icon-only buttons by CSS classes
  - Fixed error message assertions to match actual error text
  - Added async waitFor for feedback submission tests

### 4. AIErrorBoundary Tests (`tests/components/ai/AIErrorBoundary.test.tsx`)

- ✅ All 16 tests passing
- No changes needed - tests were already passing

### 5. AIGuidancePanel Tests (`tests/components/ai/AIGuidancePanel.test.tsx`)

- ✅ All 15 tests passing
- Fixed issues:
  - Updated component to fix requestId race condition
  - Added useEffect to load guidance when defaultOpen=true
  - Fixed click handler to properly trigger API calls
  - Updated test assertions for loading state and error messages
  - Fixed toast message assertions to match actual messages

## Key Technical Fixes

### 1. localStorage Mock Implementation

```typescript
// tests/setup.ts
const localStorageStore: Record<string, string> = {};
const localStorageMock = {
  getItem: vi.fn((key: string) => localStorageStore[key] || null),
  setItem: vi.fn((key: string, value: string) => {
    localStorageStore[key] = value;
  }),
  // ... other methods
};
```

### 2. Request ID Race Condition Fix

```typescript
// Fixed pattern used in AIGuidancePanel and AIHelpTooltip
setRequestId((latestRequestId) => {
  if (currentRequestId === latestRequestId) {
    setAiResponse(response);
    setLoading(false);
  }
  return latestRequestId;
});
```

### 3. Helper Method Fixes in assessments-ai.service.ts

- Fixed `getBusinessProfileFromContext` to properly capitalize industry names
- Fixed `getExistingPoliciesFromAnswers` to replace all underscores with spaces

## Console Warnings

Some expected console warnings remain from fallback testing:

- "Failed to generate AI follow-up questions: Error: AI service unavailable"
- "Failed to generate AI follow-up questions: Error: AI follow-up questions service timeout"

These are expected behavior when testing fallback mechanisms.

## Test Results

```
Test Files  5 passed (5)
Tests      59 passed (59)
```

All AI-related tests are now passing successfully!
