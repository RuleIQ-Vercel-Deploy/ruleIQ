## Implementation Guidelines for AI Agents

When implementing each task, AI agents should:

1. **Always reference the Core Foundation Documents** for technical decisions
2. **Consider all three user personas** when making UI/UX choices
3. **Follow the API Integration Map** for backend connections
4. **Maintain consistency** with the design system
5. **Write tests** for all new components and features
6. **Document** complex logic and component APIs
7. **Ensure accessibility** compliance in every component

Each task should be broken down into:
- Component structure planning
- Interface/type definitions
- Implementation with proper error handling
- Testing (unit and integration where applicable)
- Documentation

The development should be **incremental and testable** at each stage, allowing for continuous integration and deployment.
