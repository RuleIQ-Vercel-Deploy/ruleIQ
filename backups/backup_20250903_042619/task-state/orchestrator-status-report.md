## 🔐 GATE ENFORCEMENT

### P0 → P1 Transition Criteria
- ✅ All 6 P0 tasks marked complete
- ⏳ Test suite runs without collection errors
- ⏳ Core infrastructure operational
- ⏳ No blocking issues remaining

**REMINDER**: P1 work is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN until P0 gate clears 100%

## 💡 RISK ASSESSMENT

### Current Risks
- **LOW**: Final task (fixtures) has clear requirements
- **LOW**: 8+ hours remaining with 2-3 hour estimate

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple specialists available if needed
- Clear test database configuration complete
- Environment properly configured

## 📝 ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

The P0 gate is progressing exceptionally well:
- Critical blocking task (env vars) completed on time
- Database configuration completed ahead of schedule
- QA tasks resolved all syntax/import issues
- Only one straightforward task remaining

The project infrastructure is now solid with proper test environment separation, database configuration, and connection management. The final fixtures/mocks task should be straightforward given the groundwork laid.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - P0 will complete well before deadline
