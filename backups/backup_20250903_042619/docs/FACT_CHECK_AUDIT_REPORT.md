## 1. Current Fact-Checking Infrastructure Analysis

### 1.1 AI Services Fact-Checking Status

**ComplianceAssistant (`services/ai/assistant.py`)**
```python
# CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION - Lines 3020-3096
def _validate_accuracy(response: str, framework: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Basic accuracy validation with regex patterns"""
    accuracy_patterns = {
        "GDPR": {"72 hours": r"72.*hour.*notification"},
        "ISO 27001": {"risk assessment": r"risk.*assessment"},
        "SOC 2": {"trust services criteria": r"trust.*services.*criteria"}
    }
```

**Strengths**:
- Framework-specific accuracy patterns
- Confidence scoring (0-1 scale)
- Basic hallucination detection for monetary claims

**Critical Gaps**:
- Limited to regex pattern matching
- No external source verification
- Static pattern library (not updated)
- No contextual accuracy validation

### 1.2 Quality Monitoring System

**AIQualityMonitor (`services/ai/quality_monitor.py`)**
```python
# ACCURACY SCORING - Lines 260-292
def _score_accuracy(self, response_text: str, prompt: str, context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> float:
    score = 7.0  # Base score
    framework_keywords = {
        "ISO27001": ["information security", "isms", "risk assessment"],
        "GDPR": ["data protection", "privacy", "consent"],
        "SOC2": ["service organization", "trust services", "availability"]
    }
```

**Assessment**: Basic keyword-based accuracy scoring - insufficient for regulatory compliance

### 1.3 RAG Fact-Checking System

**RAGFactChecker (`services/rag_fact_checker.py`)**
```python
# FACT CHECK CONFIDENCE LEVELS
class FactCheckConfidence(Enum):
    HIGH = "high"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    LOW = "low"
    UNCERTAIN = "uncertain"

# QUALITY THRESHOLDS
self.high_confidence_threshold = 0.85
self.medium_confidence_threshold = 0.65
self.approval_threshold = 0.75
```

**Status**: Advanced framework exists but underutilized in production

---

## 2. Confidence Scoring Analysis

### 2.1 Current Implementation Scope

**Services with Confidence Scoring**:
- `services/ai/safety_manager.py` - 31 confidence references
- `services/ai/assistant.py` - 19 confidence implementations
- `services/ai/quality_monitor.py` - 11 confidence metrics
- `services/compliance_retrieval_queries.py` - 7 confidence scores
- `services/ai/fallback_system.py` - 13 confidence ratings

### 2.2 Confidence Score Distribution

**Confidence Thresholds in Use**:
```python
# Safety Manager
min_confidence_threshold: 0.7
escalation_confidence_threshold: 0.5

# Quality Monitor  
high_confidence_threshold: 0.85
medium_confidence_threshold: 0.65
approval_threshold: 0.75

# Response Processor
confidence_score: 0.8 (validation_passed) else 0.5
```

**Issue**: Inconsistent confidence thresholds across services

---

## 3. Hallucination Prevention Assessment

### 3.1 Current Detection Mechanisms

**Pattern-Based Detection** (`services/ai/assistant.py` lines 3066-3096):
```python
def _detect_hallucination(response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    suspicious_patterns = [
        r"‚Ç¨\d+,\d+.*registration.*fee",  # Fake fees
        r"\$\d+,\d+.*annual.*cost",     # Fake costs
        r"article.*\d+.*requires.*‚Ç¨",   # Fake monetary requirements
    ]
```

**Effectiveness**: LIMITED - Only detects monetary hallucinations

### 3.2 Safety Manager Integration

**Content Safety Evaluation** (`services/ai/safety_manager.py`):
- ‚úÖ Multi-level safety profiles
- ‚úÖ Role-based content filtering  
- ‚úÖ Regulatory context handling
- ‚ùå No fact-verification integration
- ‚ùå No source reliability checks

---

## 4. Source Attribution Vulnerabilities

### 4.1 RAG Source Tracking

**DocumentMetadata Structure** (`langgraph_agent/agents/rag_system.py`):
```python
@dataclass
class DocumentMetadata:
    source: DocumentSource
    frameworks: List[str]
    regulatory_version: Optional[str]
    keywords: List[str]
    entities: List[str]
```

**Source Attribution Status**:
- ‚úÖ Document source tracking
- ‚úÖ Framework attribution
- ‚úÖ Regulatory version tracking
- ‚ùå No citation verification
- ‚ùå No source reliability scoring
- ‚ùå No conflicting source detection

### 4.2 Source Reliability Gaps

**Critical Missing Features**:
1. Source authority verification
2. Publication date validation
3. Regulatory update tracking
4. Cross-source contradiction detection
5. Source bias assessment
