### Step 3: Assessment Execution

**AI-Guided Question Flow**

The assessment adapts based on your responses:

1. **Context Questions**: Business operations and data flows

**Best Practices During Assessment**
- Answer questions thoroughly and honestly
- Use "Unsure" option if you need to research further
- Add notes for context and additional information
- Save progress regularly (auto-save every 2 minutes)
- Involve subject matter experts for technical questions

**Question Types**

**Yes/No Questions**
```
Do you have a documented data retention policy?
☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ Unsure
```

**Multiple Choice**
```

```

### Step 4: Evidence Management

**Document Upload and Management**

**Supported Evidence Types:**
- Policies and procedures (PDF, DOC)
- Training records (XLS, CSV)
- Audit reports (PDF)
- Certificates and attestations (PDF, JPG)
- System screenshots (PNG, JPG)
- Configuration files (TXT, JSON)

**Evidence Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive filenames
- Ensure documents are current (within 12 months)
- Redact sensitive information before upload
- Organize by compliance area or control
- Include version numbers for policies

**AI Evidence Analysis**
The system automatically:
- Extracts key information from documents
- Validates evidence against requirements
- Identifies missing elements
- Suggests improvements

### Step 5: AI Analysis and Scoring

**Automated Compliance Scoring**

The AI engine evaluates your responses and evidence to provide:

**Overall Compliance Score** (0-100%)
- **90-100%**: Excellent compliance posture
- **75-89%**: Good compliance with minor gaps
- **60-74%**: Moderate compliance, improvements needed
- **Below 60%**: Significant compliance gaps requiring attention

**Framework-Specific Scores**
Each selected framework receives individual scoring with detailed breakdowns by control area.

**Risk Assessment**
- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Address within 30 days
- **Medium**: Address within 90 days
- **Low**: Monitor and improve over time

### Step 6: Gap Analysis and Recommendations

**Detailed Gap Analysis**

For each identified gap, you'll receive:
- **Description**: What's missing or inadequate
- **Impact**: Potential consequences of non-compliance
- **Priority**: Urgency level for remediation
- **Effort**: Estimated time and resources required

**AI-Generated Recommendations**

**Policy Recommendations**
- Template policies customized for your business
