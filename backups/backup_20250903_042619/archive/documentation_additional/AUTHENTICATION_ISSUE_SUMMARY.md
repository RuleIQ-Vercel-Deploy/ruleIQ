# Authentication Issue Summary

## Problem Overview

The core issue is a persistent `401 Unauthorized` error with the message `Token validation failed: Signature verification failed.` when testing the AI assessment endpoints. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the `JWT_SECRET` used to sign the authentication token in the test script and the secret being used by the server to verify it.

## Barriers and Diagnostic Steps

1.  **Initial `404 Not Found` Errors:** My first attempts to test the endpoints resulted in `404` errors. I corrected the router prefix in `api/routers/ai_assessments.py` and the test script URLs, which resolved the `404`s and led to the current `401` error. This confirmed that the server is running and the endpoints are reachable, but protected.

2.  **Suspected Environment Variable Loading Issue:** I hypothesized that the server was not correctly loading the `JWT_SECRET` from the `.env.local` file. To address this, I modified `config/settings.py` to ensure the `dotenv` library was called at the very top of the file, before any other code was executed.

    ```python
    # In config/settings.py
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load .env.local file at the very top to ensure variables are available
    load_dotenv(".env.local")
    ```

3.  **Persistent Signature Verification Failure:** Despite the corrected environment variable loading, the signature verification continued to fail. This suggested a more subtle issue, such as a module caching problem where the server was not picking up the corrected `JWT_SECRET`.

4.  **Diagnostic Logging and Forced Reloads:** To confirm the caching theory, I added diagnostic `print` statements to `api/auth.py` and `config/settings.py` to log the `JWT_SECRET` being used by the server. However, these logs never appeared, which confirmed that the modules were not being reloaded correctly. I then resorted to intentionally introducing and reverting a syntax error in `api/main.py` to force a clean restart of the server.

5.  **Current Stalemate:** Even with a clean restart and the corrected code, the signature verification fails, and my diagnostic logs are not appearing. This indicates a deep-rooted issue with the application's startup and configuration loading that I am unable to resolve with my current toolset.

## Key Files and Code Snippets

- **`.env.local`**: Defines the `JWT_SECRET`.

  ```
  JWT_SECRET=dev-jwt-secret-key-change-for-production
  ```

- **`ai_assessment_test.py`**: Creates the JWT token for testing.

  ```python
  # In ai_assessment_test.py
  import jwt
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  load_dotenv(".env.local")
  JWT_SECRET = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET")

  def create_test_token():
      """Creates a JWT token for a test user."""
      payload = {
          "sub": "testuser@example.com",
          "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=5)
      }
      return jwt.encode(payload, JWT_SECRET, algorithm="HS256")
  ```

- **`api/auth.py`**: Verifies the JWT token.

  ```python
  # In api/auth.py
  from jose import jwt
  from config.settings import get_settings

  settings = get_settings()

  async def get_current_user(token: str, db: Session):
      # ...
      payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.jwt_secret, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
      # ...
  ```

I have exhausted all reasonable diagnostic and remediation steps. I recommend a second opinion to investigate the application's startup and configuration loading process.
