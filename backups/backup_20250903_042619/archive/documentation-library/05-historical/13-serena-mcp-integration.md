# Serena MCP Server Integration for ruleIQ

**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Status**: âœ… Production Ready

## Overview

Serena MCP Server provides semantic code understanding through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration, offering intelligent development assistance for the ruleIQ compliance automation platform.

## Integration Components

### 1. Project Configuration
**File**: `.serena/project.yml`
- Comprehensive ruleIQ-specific configuration
- Language server settings for Python and TypeScript
- Domain knowledge for compliance frameworks
- Development workflow optimization
- Performance and resource management

### 2. Development Scripts
**Files**: 
- `scripts/start_serena_mcp.sh` - Start Serena with ruleIQ configuration
- `scripts/stop_serena_mcp.sh` - Stop Serena gracefully
- `scripts/init_dev_environment.sh` - Integrated startup with development environment

### 3. Claude Desktop MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "command": "python",
  "args": [
    "-m", "serena.mcp",
    "--context", "ide-assistant", 
    "--project", "/home/omar/Documents/ruleIQ"
  ],
  "cwd": "/home/omar/serena"
}
```

## Features Provided

### IDE Assistance
- Real-time code analysis and suggestions
- Context-aware development assistance
- Project-specific knowledge integration
- Enhanced debugging capabilities

### Integration Benefits
- Seamless integration with Claude for AI-powered development
- Automatic startup with development environment
- Clean process management and logging
- Project-specific context awareness

## Usage

### Automatic Initialization (Recommended)
```bash
# Start entire development environment including Serena MCP
./scripts/init_dev_environment.sh

# Stop all services including Serena MCP  
./scripts/stop_dev_environment.sh
```

### Manual Control
```bash
# Start Serena MCP Server manually
./scripts/start_serena_mcp.sh start

# Check server status
./scripts/start_serena_mcp.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/start_serena_mcp.sh logs

# Stop Serena MCP Server
./scripts/stop_serena_mcp.sh stop
```

### Available Tools
When connected through Claude Desktop:
- `find_symbol(symbol_name)` - Locate functions, classes, variables
- `replace_symbol_body(symbol_name, new_body)` - Modify function implementations  
- `search_for_pattern(pattern)` - Semantic pattern matching
- `get_symbol_references(symbol_name)` - Find all symbol usages
- `analyze_code_context(file_path, line_number)` - Contextual code analysis

### Verification
To verify Serena MCP is running:
1. Check process: `ps aux | grep serena-mcp-server`
2. Check PID file: `cat .serena-mcp.pid`
3. Check logs: `tail logs/serena-mcp.log`

## Prerequisites

### Installation
If Serena MCP Server is not installed:
```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g serena-mcp-server

# Or install locally
npm install serena-mcp-server
```

### Configuration
The server is pre-configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` and will be available to Claude after restart.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server not starting**
   - Check if already running: `pgrep -f serena-mcp-server`
   - Check logs: `cat logs/serena-mcp.log`
   - Verify installation: `which serena-mcp-server`

2. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
   - Check log directory exists: `mkdir -p logs`

3. **Context not available**
   - Restart Claude to reload MCP server configuration
   - Verify `.claude/settings.local.json` contains server config

## Integration Points

### Development Workflow
1. **On Project Start**: Run `./scripts/init_dev_environment.sh`
2. **During Development**: Serena MCP provides context-aware assistance
3. **On Project End**: Run `./scripts/stop_dev_environment.sh`

### Context Management
- Serena MCP has access to project context via `--context ide-assistant`
- Works alongside the context monitoring system
- Enhances AI assistance with project-specific knowledge

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Auto-restart** on crash with systemd/supervisor
2. **Health checks** for monitoring server status
3. **Performance metrics** for optimization insights
4. **Custom configurations** per developer preferences

### Integration Opportunities
1. Link with context monitoring for real-time updates
2. Custom commands for project-specific tasks
3. Enhanced debugging with breakpoint integration
4. Automated code review suggestions

---

**Integration Complete**: The Serena MCP Server is now part of the ruleIQ development environment and will automatically start when using the initialization script.
