# RuleIQ Test Coverage Status - September 2025

## Current Test Status

### Test Collection Results
- **Total Tests Found**: 467 tests collected
- **Collection Errors**: 10 tests have import/collection errors
- **Test Files**: 180+ test files in `/tests` directory

### Important Updates
- **Celery Removed**: Celery system has been completely removed from the codebase
- This affects background task processing and worker tests
- Migration to LangGraph for task orchestration

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (`/tests/unit/`)
- Services tests (AI assistant, IQ agent, caching)
- Model tests
- Utility tests (circuit breaker, async handlers)

#### Integration Tests (`/tests/integration/`)
- API endpoint tests
- Database integration
- External service integration
- JWT authentication tests
- Contract validation

#### AI/ML Tests
- `test_ai_assessment_endpoints_integration.py`
- `test_ai_policy_generator.py`
- `test_ai_policy_streaming.py`
- `test_ai_cost_management.py`
- `test_ai_ethics.py`
- Golden dataset tests

#### Compliance Tests
- `test_uk_compliance_frameworks.py`
- `test_uk_compliance_integration.py`
- `test_compliance_accuracy.py`
- `test_compliance_nodes.py`

#### Evidence Tests
- `test_evidence_orchestrator_v2.py`
- `test_evidence_nodes_*.py` (multiple coverage levels)
- `test_evidence_migration_tdd.py`

#### LangGraph Tests
- `test_langgraph_instantiation.py`
- `test_langsmith_integration.py`
- `test_graph_execution.py`
- `test_master_integration.py`

### Test Infrastructure Issues

#### Collection Errors (10 files)
These tests fail to import due to:
- Missing dependencies
- Import errors from Celery removal
- Configuration issues
- Missing environment variables

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Note**: The "0% coverage" from SonarCloud likely refers to:
  - Tests not being run in CI/CD
  - Coverage reports not being generated/uploaded
  - Tests existing but not executing due to errors

### Actual Test Presence
- **467 tests exist** in the codebase
- Tests follow proper naming conventions
- Comprehensive test structure is in place
- Main issue is execution/configuration, not absence of tests

### Required Fixes
1. Fix 10 collection errors
2. Remove Celery-dependent tests
3. Setup proper test environment variables
4. Configure coverage reporting
5. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
6. Generate and upload coverage reports to SonarCloud

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
pytest tests/e2e/

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_ai"
```

## Correction Note
The project DOES have substantial test coverage infrastructure with 467 tests.
The "0% coverage" metric is misleading - it indicates tests aren't being executed/reported properly, not that tests don't exist.
