=== Alembic Migration Fixes Summary ===

1. Migration 004 (integration_configs):
   - Fixed enum type creation to use PostgreSQL DO block with exception handling
   - Changed from SQLAlchemy enum creation to raw SQL for better control
   - Made enum creation idempotent with CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS pattern
   - Updated table creation to use raw SQL to avoid duplicate enum creation
   - Made downgrade operations use DROP IF EXISTS

2. Migration 005 (business_profile_data_sensitivity):
   - Added conditional column creation using information_schema check
   - Wrapped ALTER TABLE commands in DO block with existence checks
   - Made the migration idempotent - can be run multiple times safely

3. Migration 007 (evidence_metadata):
   - Added conditional column creation for ai_metadata columns
   - Used DO blocks with information_schema checks for both tables
   - Made index creation use CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS
   - Updated downgrade to use DROP IF EXISTS patterns

4. Migration 008 (fix_column_name_truncation):
   - Converted from direct column renames to conditional renames
   - Added checks for both old and new column names before renaming
   - Made migration skip if columns already have correct names

Key Patterns Applied:
- Use PostgreSQL DO blocks for conditional DDL operations
- Check information_schema before modifying schema
- Use IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS clauses where available
- Wrap operations in exception handlers for duplicate_object errors
- Make all migrations idempotent - safe to run multiple times

Database State Management:
- When tables are created outside migrations, use 'alembic stamp head'
- This marks the database as being at the latest migration version
- Prevents migration conflicts when tables already exist
