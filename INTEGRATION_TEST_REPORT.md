## 🔒 SEC-001 Validation Tests

### Critical Security Tests Implemented:

```python
✅ test_no_auth_bypass_for_protected_routes()
   - Verifies ALL protected routes require authentication
   - No path prefix bypass vulnerability

✅ test_public_routes_accessible()
   - Ensures public routes work without auth
   - Health checks remain accessible

✅ test_undefined_routes_require_auth()
   - New/undefined routes are protected by default
   - Secure-by-default implementation

✅ test_jwt_validation_strict()
   - Token signature verification
   - Expiration checking
   - Claims validation

✅ test_high_value_endpoints_properly_protected()
   - Admin endpoints require proper authorization
   - No privilege escalation possible
```
