"""
Advanced Caching System for RuleIQ

This module provides a comprehensive multi-level caching system that dramatically
reduces database load and improves response times through:

- Multi-level caching architecture (L1 in-memory, L2 Redis)
- Intelligent cache invalidation policies
- Cache warming strategies
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Fallback mechanisms for Redis unavailability
- Integration with database, API, and service layers

Key Components:
- CacheManager: Main caching orchestrator with built-in invalidation
- CacheMetrics: Performance monitoring and metrics
- CacheKeyBuilder: Structured key generation and versioning

Note: Cache invalidation and warming functionality is integrated into the
CacheManager class for unified cache management.
