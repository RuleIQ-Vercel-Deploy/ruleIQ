"""
AI Services Module

This module provides AI-powered compliance assistance functionality.

## Architecture

The module has been refactored into a modular architecture:
- **Providers**: AI provider abstraction (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Response**: Response generation, parsing, and formatting
- **Domains**: Domain-specific services (assessments, policies, workflows, etc.)

## Usage

### Legacy API (Recommended for existing code)
```python
from services.ai import ComplianceAssistant

assistant = ComplianceAssistant(db, user_context)
help_response = await assistant.get_assessment_help(...)
```

### New Modular API (For new code)
```python
from services.ai import AssessmentService, ProviderFactory

provider_factory = ProviderFactory(...)
assessment_service = AssessmentService(...)
help_response = await assessment_service.get_help(...)
```

## Migration

The `ComplianceAssistant` class is now a façade that delegates to the new
modular architecture. All existing code continues to work without changes.
New code should prefer using the domain services directly for better
testability and maintainability.
