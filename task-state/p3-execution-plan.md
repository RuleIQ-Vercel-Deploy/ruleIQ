## Risk Mitigation

1. **Test Coverage Risk**: Start with critical paths first
2. **Security Risk**: Prioritize high-severity issues
3. **Integration Risk**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
4. **Performance Risk**: Implement caching and optimization early

## Communication Protocol

- Daily standup at 9 AM UTC
- Progress updates every 4 hours
- Blocker escalation within 1 hour
- Weekly stakeholder report on Fridays
