# ruleIQ Context Specification

## Overview

This document defines the context management system for the ruleIQ compliance automation platform. It establishes standards for documenting, tracking, and maintaining architectural context across all platform components.

## Context Management Principles

### 1. **Completeness**
- All major components must have documented context
- Dependencies and relationships must be explicitly mapped
- Changes affecting context must be tracked

### 2. **Accuracy**
- Context documentation must reflect current implementation
- Outdated context must be updated or marked as deprecated
- Regular context audits ensure alignment with codebase

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Context documentation uses standardized formats
- Streamlined file structure with 13 essential files
- Clear navigation and single sources of truth
- Visual representations supplement textual descriptions
- Context is discoverable through clear navigation

## Context Categories

### **System Architecture Context**
- High-level system design and component relationships
- Technology stack and infrastructure decisions
- Deployment and environment configurations

### **Component Context**
- Individual component responsibilities and interfaces
- Internal implementation details and patterns
- Dependencies and integration points

### **Data Context**
- Database schema and model relationships
- Data flow patterns and transformations
- API contract specifications

### **Business Context**
- Domain logic and business rules
- Compliance requirements and regulations
- User personas and workflow patterns

## Context File Structure

### **Essential Context Files** (13 files)

#### **Core Documentation**
1. **README.md** - Context overview and navigation
2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Current project status and deployment readiness
3. **CONTEXT_SPECIFICATION.md** - This document (context management standards)

```

### **Visual Documentation Standards**

#### **Dependency Diagrams**
- Use consistent shapes: rectangles for services, cylinders for databases, clouds for external services
- Color coding: green for stable, yellow for in-development, red for deprecated
- Arrow styles: solid for strong dependencies, dashed for optional, dotted for event-driven

#### **Data Flow Diagrams**
- Show request/response patterns
- Include error handling paths
- Highlight security boundaries
- Document transformation points

#### **Component Relationship Maps**
- Hierarchical organization by domain
- Interface boundaries clearly marked
- Shared dependencies highlighted
- Communication patterns indicated

## Context Change Management

### **Change Detection Triggers**
1. **File System Changes**
   - New files added to key directories
   - Modifications to interface definitions
   - Database schema changes

2. **Code Changes**
   - New API endpoints
   - Modified service interfaces
   - Updated dependency declarations

3. **Documentation Changes**
   - Architecture decision records
   - API specification updates
   - Deployment configuration changes

### **Change Impact Assessment**
```markdown
## Change Impact Assessment Template

### Change Description
Brief description of what changed and why.

### Affected Components
- **Direct Impact**: Components directly modified
- **Indirect Impact**: Components affected by changes
- **Potential Impact**: Components that may be affected

### Risk Assessment
- **Breaking Changes**: Y/N and description
- **Performance Impact**: Expected changes to performance
- **Security Impact**: Security implications
- **Compatibility**: Backward/forward compatibility considerations

### Required Updates
- [ ] Documentation updates needed
- [ ] Test coverage updates
- [ ] Deployment changes required
- [ ] Team communication needed

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scans clean
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Context Maintenance Protocols

### **Regular Audits**
- **Weekly**: Check context for actively developed components
- **Monthly**: Full system context review
- **Release**: Complete context validation before production deployment

### **Responsibility Matrix**
- **Component Owners**: Maintain component-specific context
- **Architecture Team**: Maintain system-level context
- **DevOps Team**: Maintain infrastructure and deployment context
- **Security Team**: Maintain security and compliance context

### **Context Quality Metrics**
- **Coverage**: Percentage of components with documented context
- **Freshness**: Age of context documentation relative to code changes
- **Accuracy**: Results of context validation against implementation
- **Usability**: Developer feedback on context usefulness

## Context Integration Points

### **Development Workflow**
- Context review as part of code review process
- Context updates included in definition of done
- Context validation in CI/CD pipeline

### **Onboarding Process**
- Context documentation as primary resource for new developers
- Guided context tours for different platform areas
- Context contribution as part of early development tasks

### **Architecture Decision Process**
- Context impact analysis required for architectural changes
- Context updates as deliverable for architecture decisions
- Context review by architecture review board

## Tools and Automation

### **Documentation Generation**
- Automated dependency mapping from code analysis
- API documentation generation from OpenAPI specs
