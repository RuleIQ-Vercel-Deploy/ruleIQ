# ruleIQ Historical Files Archive

This directory contains files that were moved out of the main codebase during the production cleanup phase. These files represent important historical context but are not needed for current development or deployment.

## Archive Date
**Initial cleanup:** July 10, 2025
**Additional cleanup:** July 17, 2025
**Reason:** Production deployment cleanup - removing temporary files, outdated documentation, and development artifacts to create a clean deployment-ready codebase.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ debugging_scripts/
Contains temporary debugging and testing scripts that were created during development phases but are not part of the formal test suite.

**Files:**
- `debug_db.py` - Database connection debugging
- `diagnose_tests.py` - Test diagnostic utilities
- `test_*.py` - Various temporary test scripts created during development
- `run_chunked_tests.py` - Chunked test execution script
- `setup_local_test_db.py` - Local database setup for debugging

**Why archived:** These scripts were created for specific debugging scenarios during development. They served their purpose but are not needed for production deployment or ongoing development.

### üìÅ documentation/
Contains project documentation that represents historical milestones, completed phases, and past decision-making processes.

**Files:**
- `HANDOVER.md` - Project handover documentation
- `TEST_HANDOVER.md` - Test suite handover documentation  
- `CRITICAL_FIXES_CHECKLIST.md` - Completed critical fixes
- `AI_CHECKLIST.md` - AI implementation checklist (completed)
- `DATABASE_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of database fixes applied
- `FOUNDATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Foundation phase completion
- `PHASE5_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Phase 5 milestone report
- `The-Final-39-Test-Failures.md` - Historical test failure analysis

- `MCP_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md` - MCP integration planning
- `SERENA_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` - Serena MCP integration guide
- `AI_CONTEXT.md` - AI development context

**Why archived:** These documents capture important historical context about the development process, decisions made, and milestones achieved. They're valuable for understanding the project's evolution but not needed for current operations.

### üìÅ test_configs/
Contains historical versions of test configuration files that were created during iterative improvement of the test suite.

- `conftest_ai_optimization.py` - AI optimization test config
- `temp_direct_importer.py` - Temporary import helper
- `temp_test_importer.py` - Temporary test import utilities

**Why archived:** These represent the evolution of the test configuration. The current `tests/conftest.py` incorporates the best practices from these iterations.

### üìÅ migration_scripts/
Contains one-time migration scripts, database fixes, and development utilities that were used during specific phases but are no longer needed.

**Files:**
- `clean_test_database.py` - Test database cleanup

- `database_schema_fix.py` - Schema repair script
- `context_monitor.py` - Development context monitoring
- `migrate_evidence.py` - One-time evidence migration

**Why archived:** These scripts were created for specific migration tasks, database fixes, or development workflow improvements. They served their purpose and are preserved for reference but not needed for ongoing operations.

### üìÅ test_artifacts/
Contains generated test results and metrics files.

**Files:**
- `test_results.json` - Test execution results
- `test_session_metrics.json` - Test session performance metrics

**Why archived:** These are output artifacts from test runs, not source code. They provide historical performance data but don't need to be in the main codebase.

### üìÅ test_scripts_additional/
Contains additional test scripts moved during final cleanup phase.

**Files:**
- `test_ab_testing.py` - A/B testing framework validation script
- `test_statistical_analysis.py` - Statistical analysis components testing

**Why archived:** These are specialized testing scripts for statistical analysis features. While functional, they're not part of the formal test suite and were moved to reduce root directory clutter.

### üìÅ documentation_additional/
Contains additional temporary documentation moved during final cleanup.

**Files:**
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of validation fixes applied
- `FRONTEND_TEST_HANDOVER.md` - Frontend testing handover documentation
- `COMPLIANCE_TEST_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Compliance testing fixes summary
- `MEMORY_LEAK_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Memory leak resolution documentation
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` - Production readiness checklist (completed)
- `SECURITY_CHECKLIST_STATUS.md` - Security checklist status (completed)
- `PROJECT_TASKS.md` - Project task tracking (completed)
- `FIXED_TEST_DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Test database setup fixes
- `FRONTEND_TEST_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Frontend testing action plan (completed)

**Why archived:** These documents represent completed work phases, fix summaries, and temporary documentation that served their purpose during development but are no longer needed for ongoing operations.

### üìÅ temporary_files/
Contains temporary utility scripts and one-off files created during development.

**Files:**
- `fix_settings.py` - Settings configuration fix script
- `revert_api_main.py` - API main reversion script
- `validate_production.py` - Production validation script
- `check_routes.py` - Route validation utility
- `screenshot-all-pages.js` - Frontend screenshot automation
- `runpod_quick_setup.sh` - RunPod deployment setup script
- `sync_to_runpod.sh` - RunPod synchronization script
- `create-documentation-library.sh` - Documentation generation script

**Why archived:** These are utility scripts created for specific one-time tasks, debugging, or deployment scenarios. They served their purpose but are not part of the core application infrastructure.

## What Remains in Main Codebase

### Active Files
- **Core Application:** `main.py`, `celery_app.py`, `/api/`, `/services/`, `/database/`
- **Configuration:** Docker files, pytest configs, application settings
- **Active Scripts:** Production deployment scripts, worker startup scripts
- **Current Documentation:** `readme.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- **Formal Test Suite:** `/tests/` directory with current test configurations

## Recovery Instructions

If any of these historical files are needed again:

1. **For debugging scripts:** Most functionality is now covered by the formal test suite in `/tests/`
2. **For documentation:** Refer to current docs in the main directory; historical context is preserved here
3. **For test configs:** The current `tests/conftest.py` incorporates best practices from all iterations
4. **For migration scripts:** These were one-time operations; database is now properly initialized

## Important Notes

- **Security:** `TEST_USER_CREDENTIALS.md` contains test credentials - ensure these are not used in production
- **Dependencies:** Some scripts may have dependencies that are no longer installed
- **Compatibility:** Files may reference deprecated configurations or structures
- **Documentation:** Historical docs may not reflect current implementation
