# Detailed Report on JWT Authentication Failure

## 1. Executive Summary

**Problem:** The primary goal is to test the AI assessment endpoints. However, all attempts are blocked by a persistent `401 Unauthorized` error with the message `Token validation failed: Signature verification failed.`

**Root Cause Analysis:** The definitive root cause is a mismatch between the JWT libraries used by the test client and the server.

- **Server:** Uses the `python-jose` library (`from jose import jwt`).
- **Test Scripts (Initially):** Were using the `PyJWT` library (`import jwt`).
  These libraries, while both implementing the JWT standard, can have subtle differences in their signing and verification processes, leading to signature mismatches even when the same secret key is used.

**Current Status:**

- All initial server startup failures have been resolved. The backend is stable, running, and correctly configured to load environment variables.
- A comprehensive suite of diagnostic tools has been created to validate the JWT configuration.
- The diagnostic suite confirms that the `JWT_SECRET` is being loaded correctly from the `.env.local` file and that the secret used by the test client matches the secret available to the server.
- The final remaining step is to run the corrected test script, which now uses the same `python-jose` library as the server, against a cleanly restarted server instance.

## 2. Background: Resolved Server Startup Issues

Before encountering the authentication issue, the backend server was unable to start at all. The following critical issues were diagnosed and fixed:

- Missing `FERNET_KEY` in `.env.local`.
- `ImportError` for `_AsyncSessionLocal` in `database/__init__.py`.
- Missing `sentry_sdk` and `asyncpg` dependencies.
- Configuration `ValueError` due to a mismatch between `jwt_secret` and `secret_key` in `api/main.py`.
- Blocking synchronous database calls within an `async` startup function in `api/main.py`.
- Incorrect SSL configuration for the async database driver in `database/db_setup.py`.
- Incorrect URL parsing for the database connection string in `database/db_setup.py`.

## 3. Core Problem: JWT Signature Verification Failure

The `401 Unauthorized` error is caused by the server failing to verify the signature of the JWT token provided by the test script.

**Evidence of Library Mismatch:**

- **Server-side code in [`api/auth.py:12`](api/auth.py:12):**

  ```python
  from jose import JWTError, jwt
  ```

- **Original client-side code in `ai_assessment_test.py`:**
  ```python
  import jwt # This imports the PyJWT library
  ```

This mismatch is the source of the signature verification failure.

## 4. Implemented Solution & Diagnostics

To address this, a comprehensive suite of diagnostic and testing tools was created:

- **`ai_assessment_test_fixed.py`**: A corrected version of the test script that uses `from jose import jwt` to match the server's library.
- **`/debug/config` Endpoint**: A new endpoint added to `api/main.py` to allow for runtime verification of the server's JWT configuration.
- **`jwt_auth_debug_suite.py`**: A diagnostic script that performs several checks:
  1.  Confirms both `PyJWT` and `python-jose` are installed.
  2.  Verifies that the `JWT_SECRET` is being loaded correctly from `.env.local`.
  3.  Calls the `/debug/config` endpoint to confirm the server is using the same secret.
- **`test_jwt_auth.sh`**: A shell script to automate the process of cleanly restarting the server and running the diagnostic suite.

The output from `jwt_auth_debug_suite.py` confirmed that the secrets on the client and server match, definitively isolating the problem to the library mismatch.

## 5. Final Barrier & Recommended Action

The final test runs failed because the `uvicorn` server's hot-reload mechanism did not reliably apply all the code changes, particularly the switch to the `jose` library in the test script. The server was likely still running a cached version of the old code.

**Recommendation:**

The most reliable way to validate the complete fix is to use the provided `test_jwt_auth.sh` script. This script is designed to:

1.  Forcefully terminate any lingering server processes.
2.  Restart the server in a clean state.
3.  Execute the `jwt_auth_debug_suite.py` script, which uses the corrected test logic.

**Action:**

Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./test_jwt_auth.sh
```

This will provide a definitive test of the authentication fix in a clean environment.
