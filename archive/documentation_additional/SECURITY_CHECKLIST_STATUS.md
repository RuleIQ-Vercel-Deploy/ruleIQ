## Security Checklist Status Report

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Data Integrity Lockdown

#### ✅ 1.1 (API) Remove hardcoded SECRET_KEY and enforce environment variable loading
**Status: COMPLETED**
- SECRET_KEY in `api/dependencies/auth.py` uses `os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", secrets.token_urlsafe(32))`
- Fallback generates a random key rather than using a hardcoded value
- Environment variable validation is in place in deployment scripts

#### ✅ 1.2 (AI) Replace pickle with json for secure data serialization in instruction_monitor.py
**Status: COMPLETED**
- No pickle usage found in `services/ai/instruction_monitor.py`
- JSON is already being used for serialization (metrics.json, performance.json)

#### ✅ 1.3 (API) Fix mass assignment vulnerabilities in business_profiles.py and evidence_service.py
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Both files use comprehensive whitelist validation
- `business_profiles.py` uses `validate_business_profile_update` with field whitelisting
- `evidence_service.py` uses `validate_evidence_update` and explicit ALLOWED_FIELDS
- Proper input validation prevents mass assignment attacks

#### ❓ 1.4 (API) Remove insecure credential storage fallback in base_integration.py
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**
- No obvious credential fallback patterns found in the file
- Need to examine the full file to confirm

#### ⚠️ 1.5 (DB) Remediate schema management: remove create_all() and establish a single Alembic baseline
**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
- Alembic baseline has been established and is working correctly
- However, `create_all()` is still present in:
  - `database/init_db.py`
  - `tests/conftest.py`
  - Test files for development/testing purposes

### Phase 2: High-Priority Hardening

#### ❓ 2.1 (API) Implement multi-layered file upload validation
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### ❓ 2.2 (AI) Add role-based authorization to the AdvancedSafetyManager
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### ❓ 2.3 (API) Replace the in-memory token blacklist with a shared Redis implementation
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

### Phase 3: Reliability & Best Practices

#### ❓ 3.1 (AI) Implement prompt injection defenses (sanitization and fencing)
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### ✅ 3.2 (DB) Add CHECK constraints to database models for data integrity
**Status: COMPLETED**
- CHECK constraint successfully added to `compliance_frameworks.version` field
- Constraint ensures version follows semantic versioning pattern
- Migration has been applied to the database

#### ❓ 3.3 (AI) Implement rigorous statistical tests (t-test/chi-squared) for A/B testing
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

### Phase 4: Optimization & Cleanup

#### ❓ 4.1 (AI) Centralize AI prompt template caching using Redis
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### ❓ 4.2 (DB) Consolidate the redundant Evidence model
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### ❓ 4.3 (AI) Implement the placeholder plan_generator.py with full AI integration
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

### Final Step

#### ⏳ 5.1 Synthesize all findings and implemented solutions into a final report
**Status: IN PROGRESS**
