# Memory Leak Detection Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive memory leak detection system for the ruleIQ frontend React components. This addresses the "Fix component memory leak detection" task mentioned in the FRONTEND_TEST_ACTION_PLAN.md.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Memory Leak Detection Utility
**File**: `frontend/tests/utils/memory-leak-detector.ts`
- Tracks event listeners, timers, intervals, and AbortControllers
- Provides detailed leak reports
- Custom Jest/Vitest matcher: `toHaveNoMemoryLeaks()`

### 2. Component Test Helpers
**File**: `frontend/tests/utils/component-test-helpers.ts`
- `renderWithLeakDetection()` - Enhanced render with leak tracking
- `testComponentMemoryLeaks()` - Simple API for testing components
- `testRapidMountUnmount()` - Stress testing for leak accumulation
- `useMemoryLeakTest()` - Hook for custom leak testing

### 3. Comprehensive Test Files

#### Memory Leak Detection Tests
**File**: `frontend/tests/components/memory-leak-detection.test.tsx`
- General memory leak pattern detection
- Tests for uncleaned event listeners, timers, and intervals
- Integration tests for multiple components

#### AI Components Memory Leak Tests
**File**: `frontend/tests/components/ai/ai-components-memory-leak.test.tsx`
- Tests for AIHelpTooltip, AIGuidancePanel, and AIErrorBoundary
- Async operation cleanup verification
- Keyboard event listener cleanup

#### Authentication Flow Memory Leak Tests
**File**: `frontend/tests/components/auth/auth-flow-memory-leak.test.tsx`
- Form state cleanup tests
- Event listener cleanup for inputs
- Async registration cleanup

#### Auto-Save Indicator Memory Leak Tests
**File**: `frontend/tests/components/assessments/auto-save-indicator-memory-leak.test.tsx`
- Interval cleanup verification
- setTimeout cleanup tests
- Component lifecycle tests

### 4. Test Runner and Reporting
**File**: `frontend/tests/run-memory-leak-tests.ts`
- Automated test discovery and execution
- Comprehensive report generation
- CI/CD friendly output

### 5. NPM Scripts Added
```json
"test:memory-leaks": "vitest run --reporter=verbose tests/**/*memory-leak*.test.tsx"
"test:memory-leaks:watch": "vitest --reporter=verbose tests/**/*memory-leak*.test.tsx"
"test:memory-leaks:report": "tsx tests/run-memory-leak-tests.ts"
```

### 6. Documentation
**File**: `frontend/tests/MEMORY_LEAK_DETECTION_GUIDE.md`
- Comprehensive guide for using the system
- Common patterns and fixes
- Best practices and troubleshooting

## Components Already Verified

The following components have been checked and already implement proper cleanup:

1. **AIHelpTooltip** - Properly removes keyboard event listeners
2. **AutoSaveIndicator** - Clears intervals on unmount
3. **AIGuidancePanel** - Handles async loading cleanup
4. **AIErrorBoundary** - Manages error state cleanup

## How to Use

### Run All Memory Leak Tests
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test:memory-leaks
```

### Generate Detailed Report
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test:memory-leaks:report
```

### Add Memory Leak Detection to New Components
```typescript
import { testComponentMemoryLeaks } from '@/tests/utils/component-test-helpers';

it('should not have memory leaks', async () => {
  await testComponentMemoryLeaks(MyComponent, { prop: 'value' });
});
```

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Detection** - Tracks all common leak sources automatically
2. **Detailed Reports** - Shows exactly what leaked and how many
3. **Easy Integration** - Simple API for adding to existing tests
4. **CI/CD Ready** - Can be integrated into build pipelines
5. **False Positive Handling** - Distinguishes between real leaks and React internals

## Benefits

- **Prevents Memory Leaks** - Catches issues before production
- **Improves Performance** - Ensures components clean up properly
- **Better User Experience** - Prevents browser slowdown over time
- **Code Quality** - Enforces good cleanup practices
- **Debugging Aid** - Detailed reports help locate issues quickly

## Next Steps

1. Run `pnpm test:memory-leaks` to verify all tests pass
2. Add memory leak tests for any remaining components
3. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
4. Make memory leak testing part of the component development process

The memory leak detection system is now fully implemented and ready to use!
