# Security Measures for Compliance

## Overview

ruleIQ implements enterprise-grade security measures designed to meet UK compliance requirements including GDPR, ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials, and SOC 2. This document outlines the security controls, implementation details, and compliance mappings.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

**JWT-Based Authentication**
- Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- AES-GCM encryption for token storage
- Refresh token rotation for long-term sessions
- Automatic token blacklisting on logout

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Granular permission system
- Resource-level access controls
- Audit logging for all access attempts
- Dynamic role assignment and revocation

**Implementation:**
```python
# Authentication middleware
class RBACMiddleware:
    async def __call__(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # JWT validation and role verification
        # Audit logging for compliance
        # Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
```

**Compliance Mappings:**
- **GDPR Article 32**: Technical and organizational measures
- **ISO 27001 A.9**: Access control management
- **Cyber Essentials**: User access control
- **SOC 2 CC6**: Logical and physical access controls

### 2. Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest**
- Database-level encryption for sensitive data
- File encryption for uploaded evidence
- Encrypted configuration management
- Secure key management with rotation

**Encryption in Transit**
- TLS 1.3 for all client communications
- Certificate-based authentication
- HSTS headers for transport security
- Secure WebSocket connections

**Data Minimization**
- Field-level data classification
- Automatic data retention policies
- Privacy-by-design data collection
- Data anonymization capabilities

**Implementation:**
```python
# Secure data handling
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class SecureDataHandler:
    def encrypt_sensitive_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        """Encrypt sensitive data before storage"""
        
    def implement_data_retention(self, days: int):
        """Automatic data deletion per retention policy"""
```

**Compliance Mappings:**
- **GDPR Article 25**: Data protection by design
- **GDPR Article 32**: Security of processing
- **ISO 27001 A.10**: Cryptography
- **SOC 2 CC6.7**: Encryption of data

### 3. Input Validation & Security

**Comprehensive Input Validation**

- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection with content sanitization
- File upload security scanning

**API Security**
- Rate limiting per endpoint and user
- Request size limitations
- CORS policy enforcement
- Security headers implementation

**Implementation:**
```python
# Input validation system
from utils.input_validation import validate_input

@validate_input({
    "company_name": {"type": "string", "max_length": 100, "pattern": r"^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-\.]+$"},
    "email": {"type": "email", "required": True}
})
async def create_business_profile(data: dict):
    """Secure endpoint with comprehensive validation"""
```

**Security Headers:**
```python
# Security middleware implementation
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY", 
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
}
```

**Compliance Mappings:**
- **OWASP Top 10**: Injection prevention, broken authentication
- **ISO 27001 A.14**: System acquisition and maintenance
- **Cyber Essentials**: Secure configuration
- **SOC 2 CC6.8**: Protection against unauthorized access

### 4. Audit Logging & Monitoring

**Comprehensive Audit Trail**
- All user actions logged with timestamps
- Administrative action tracking
- Data access and modification logs
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring

**Security Event Monitoring**
- Real-time threat detection
- Anomaly detection for user behavior
- Automated alert generation
- Integration with SIEM systems

**Implementation:**
```python
# Audit logging system
class SecurityAuditLogger:
    async def log_user_action(self, user_id: str, action: str, resource: str):
        """Log user actions for compliance audit trail"""
        
    async def log_security_event(self, event_type: str, severity: str, details: dict):
        """Log security events for monitoring"""
```

**Compliance Mappings:**
- **GDPR Article 30**: Records of processing activities
- **ISO 27001 A.12.4**: Logging and monitoring
- **SOC 2 CC7**: System monitoring
- **UK GDPR**: Breach notification requirements

### 5. Data Privacy Controls

**GDPR Compliance Features**
- Data subject rights management (access, portability, erasure)
- Consent management and tracking
- Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) workflows
- Privacy notice generation and management

**Data Processing Controls**
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Data retention policy automation
- Cross-border data transfer controls
- Third-party data sharing agreements

**Implementation:**
```python
# GDPR compliance features
class GDPRComplianceManager:
    async def handle_subject_access_request(self, user_id: str):
        """Generate complete data export for data subject"""
        
    async def handle_right_to_erasure(self, user_id: str):
        """Securely delete all user data per GDPR Article 17"""
        
    async def generate_privacy_notice(self, processing_purpose: str):
        """Auto-generate privacy notices per GDPR Articles 13-14"""
```

**Compliance Mappings:**
