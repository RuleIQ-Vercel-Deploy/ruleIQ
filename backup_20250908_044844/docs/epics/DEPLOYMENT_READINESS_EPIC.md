# Epic: Production Deployment Readiness - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Resolve all critical deployment blockers within 5 days to achieve production readiness and launch RuleIQ to capture the growing UK SMB compliance market opportunity.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:
- **Current relevant functionality**: Full-featured compliance platform with assessment engine, report generation, and evidence management
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 15.4.7, React 19, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Integration points**: Authentication system, API layer, database migrations, CI/CD pipelines

### Enhancement Details:
- **What's being added/changed**: Fixing 15-20 failing frontend tests, resolving directory structure issues, completing environment configuration
- **How it integrates**: Updates to existing test mocks, configuration files, and build processes without changing core functionality
- **Success criteria**: 100% test pass rate, successful staging deployment, production launch with <1% error rate

## Compatibility Requirements

- [✓] Existing APIs remain unchanged - only test fixes
- [✓] Database schema changes are backward compatible - no schema changes
- [✓] UI changes follow existing patterns - no UI changes, only test fixes
- [✓] Performance impact is minimal - optimizations only

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks:

1. **Risk**: Test failures indicate deeper architectural issues
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental fixing with validation at each step
   - **Rollback Plan**: Revert commits if breaking changes detected

2. **Risk**: Environment configuration breaks integrations
   - **Mitigation**: Test each service connection individually
   - **Rollback Plan**: Maintain backup of working configuration

3. **Risk**: Production deployment causes downtime
   - **Mitigation**: Blue-green deployment with staged rollout
   - **Rollback Plan**: Instant switch back to previous version

## Definition of Done

- [✓] All 13 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [✓] Zero failing tests across all test suites
- [✓] Staging deployment validated with full test suite
- [✓] Production deployment successful with health checks passing
- [✓] Error rate below 1% in first 24 hours
- [✓] All existing functionality verified through testing
- [✓] Integration points working correctly
- [✓] Documentation updated appropriately
- [✓] No regression in existing features
- [✓] Support team briefed and monitoring active
