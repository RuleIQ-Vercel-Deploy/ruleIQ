# ISO Standards: Official Metadata vs. Actual Requirements

## What We Now Have: Official ISO Metadata

### ‚úÖ Successfully Extracted from ISO Open Data

Using the official ISO Open Data (licensed under ODC-By v1.0), we now have **authentic metadata** for 6 SMB-relevant standards:

1. **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - Information security management systems
   - Publication Date: 2022-10-25
   - Edition: 3
   - Owner Committee: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27
   - Official ID: 77618

2. **ISO 9001:2015** - Quality management systems
   - Publication Date: 2015-09-22
   - Edition: 5
   - Owner Committee: ISO/TC 176/SC 2
   - Official ID: 62085

3. **ISO 14001:2015** - Environmental management systems
   - Publication Date: 2015-09-14
   - Edition: 3
   - Owner Committee: ISO/TC 207/SC 1
   - Official ID: 60857

4. **ISO 31000:2018** - Risk management
   - Publication Date: 2018-02-14
   - Edition: 2
   - Owner Committee: ISO/TC 262
   - Official ID: 65694

5. **ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018** - IT Service management
   - Publication Date: 2018-09-14
   - Edition: 3
   - Owner Committee: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 40
   - Official ID: 70636

6. **ISO 37301:2021** - Compliance management systems
   - Publication Date: 2021-04-13
   - Edition: 1
   - Owner Committee: ISO/TC 309
   - Official ID: 75080

### What This Metadata Provides

- **Standard identification**: Official reference numbers and IDs
- **Version control**: Publication dates and edition numbers
- **Committee ownership**: Which ISO technical committee maintains each standard
- **Classification**: ICS codes for categorization
- **Basic descriptions**: High-level abstracts (when available in the metadata)

## ‚ùå What We DON'T Have: Actual Requirements

### Missing from Official Metadata

The ISO Open Data does **NOT** include:

1. **Actual clause requirements** (e.g., "The organization SHALL...")
2. **Specific control objectives** from each clause
3. **Implementation requirements** for each control
4. **Annex A controls** (for ISO 27001)
5. **Detailed guidance** on how to implement each requirement
6. **Audit criteria** and evidence requirements

### What Real Extraction Would Require

To extract actual implementable requirements (like we did with UK regulations), we would need:

1. **Purchase the full standards** ($150-300 each from ISO.org)
2. **Parse the PDF documents** to extract:
   - Normative requirements (SHALL statements)
   - Control objectives
   - Implementation guidance
   - Annexes and appendices
3. **Map requirements to SMB context** with proper scaling guidance

## üìä Comparison: UK Regulations vs. ISO Standards

| Aspect | UK Regulations | ISO Standards |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Source Documents** | ‚úÖ 36 official XML files from legislation.gov.uk | ‚ùå Only metadata from ISO Open Data |
| **Actual Requirements** | ‚úÖ 976 extracted obligations with full legal text | ‚ùå No actual requirement text available |
| **Implementation Details** | ‚úÖ Specific compliance requirements | ‚ùå Only high-level descriptions |
| **Authenticity** | ‚úÖ 100% - Direct from government sources | ‚ö†Ô∏è Metadata only - not actual standards |
| **Production Readiness** | ‚úÖ Ready for compliance assessment | ‚ùå Need full standards for implementation |

## üéØ Current Status for SMBs

### What We Can Provide

With the official ISO metadata, we can:
- Identify which standards are relevant
- Confirm current versions and publication dates
- Understand the scope of each standard
- Link to official ISO committees

### What We Cannot Provide (Without Full Standards)

- Specific compliance requirements
- Implementation checklists
- Audit criteria
- Control mappings
- Gap analysis templates

## üí° Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **UK Compliance**: ‚úÖ Use the 108 obligations extracted from official sources
2. **ISO Frameworks**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Current data is educational/template only

### To Get Real ISO Requirements

Options for organizations:
1. **Purchase standards** directly from ISO or national bodies
2. **Use consultants** who have licensed access
3. **Join standards committees** for access during development
4. **Use free alternatives** like NIST CSF (which IS freely available)

## üîç Key Insight

The fundamental difference:
- **UK Regulations**: Published freely by government ‚Üí We extracted real requirements
- **ISO Standards**: Copyrighted documents sold by ISO ‚Üí We only have metadata

The 53 "obligations" created earlier were **interpretations based on public descriptions**, not actual extracted requirements from the standards themselves.

## ‚úÖ What's Actually Production-Ready

1. **UK Regulatory Compliance**: 108 real obligations from 36 official documents
2. **ISO Metadata**: Official publication info, versions, and committees
3. **Neo4j Structure**: Graph database ready to receive real ISO requirements when available

## üö´ What's NOT Production-Ready

1. **ISO Requirements**: Need to be extracted from purchased standards
2. **SMB Guidance**: Should be validated by certified professionals
3. **Compliance Mappings**: Require actual standard text to be accurate

---

**Bottom Line**: We have **authentic UK compliance data** ready for production use, and **official ISO metadata** that confirms which standards exist and their current versions. To get actual ISO requirements comparable to our UK extraction, the full standards must be purchased and processed.
