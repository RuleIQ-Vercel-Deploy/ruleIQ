final_verdict:
  decision: PASS
  rationale: |
    All P0.5 security fixes have been successfully implemented with high quality.
    The implementation demonstrates excellent security practices, comprehensive
    testing, and production readiness. The WebSocket JWT migration properly
    maintains backward compatibility while enforcing security best practices.
    Database pooling is optimally configured for both development and production
    environments. Grafana security has been hardened with strong credentials.
    
  conditions: |
    - Execute load tests before production deployment
    - Monitor connection pool metrics post-deployment
    - Address security logging in next iteration
