notes: |
  This epic is in a critical state with fundamental implementation gaps.
  The empty QueryCategory enum is a hard blocker that prevents any functionality.
  All six stories are interdependent and blocked by Story 1's enum issue.
  
  Priority sequence:
  1. Fix QueryCategory enum (Story 1) - IMMEDIATE
  2. Fix async/await and LLM issues (Stories 3-4) - URGENT
  3. Create infrastructure (Story 5) - HIGH
  4. Align schemas (Story 2) - MEDIUM
  5. Complete testing (Story 6) - AFTER 1-5
  
  This epic should not proceed to development until the enum is populated.
