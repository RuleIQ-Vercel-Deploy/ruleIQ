  points: 13
  priority: Critical (P0)

gate_decision:
  status: CONCERNS  # PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
  reviewer: Quinn

rationale: |
  The orchestrator design is comprehensive and well-architected with excellent
  component separation, scalability features, and observability. However, critical
  gaps in state persistence and distributed system handling must be addressed
  before implementation. The architecture shows strong understanding of orchestration
  patterns but needs hardening for production reliability.

critical_issues:
  - issue: State Persistence Gap
    severity: HIGH
    description: No clear mechanism for orchestrator state recovery after restart
    impact: Complete loss of agent states and in-flight tasks on restart
    recommendation: Implement periodic state snapshots to PostgreSQL with recovery
    
  - issue: Transaction Boundaries Undefined
    severity: HIGH  
    description: No transaction management for distributed multi-step operations
    impact: System could be left in inconsistent state on partial failures
    recommendation: Implement Saga pattern or two-phase commit
    
  - issue: Network Partition Handling
    severity: HIGH
    description: No strategy for split-brain scenarios in distributed setup
    impact: Risk of duplicate task execution or lost tasks
    recommendation: Add consensus mechanism or leader election with Redis Sentinel

medium_issues:
  - issue: Poison Message Handling
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: Dead letter queue present but no clear poison message strategy
    recommendation: Add max retry limits and manual inspection queue
    
  - issue: Resource Starvation
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: Fair scheduling mentioned but implementation not detailed
    recommendation: Implement weighted fair queuing with anti-starvation
    
  - issue: Protocol Versioning
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: No version negotiation for agent-orchestrator protocol
    recommendation: Add version handshake during agent connection

strengths:
  - Well-structured component architecture with clear separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive observability with metrics, logging, and health checks
  - Strong security posture with JWT auth, rate limiting, and audit logging
  - Scalable design using Redis, WebSocket, and async patterns
  - Good test scenarios covering unit, integration, and performance

test_gaps:
  - Chaos engineering and failure injection tests missing
  - No network partition simulation tests
  - Security penetration testing not mentioned
  - Long-running soak tests not defined
  - State recovery testing not covered

risk_matrix:
  - risk: State Loss on Restart
    probability: HIGH
    impact: CRITICAL
    mitigation_status: NOT_IMPLEMENTED
    
  - risk: Resource Deadlock
    probability: MEDIUM
    impact: HIGH
    mitigation_status: PARTIAL
    
  - risk: Task Duplication
    probability: MEDIUM
    impact: HIGH
    mitigation_status: NOT_IMPLEMENTED
    
  - risk: Agent Zombies
    probability: MEDIUM
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation_status: PARTIAL
    
  - risk: Cascade Failures
    probability: LOW
    impact: CRITICAL
    mitigation_status: NOT_IMPLEMENTED

conditions_for_pass:
  - Add detailed state persistence and recovery mechanism
  - Define transaction boundaries and consistency model
  - Specify network partition handling strategy
  - Add chaos engineering test scenarios
  - Document failover and disaster recovery procedures
  - Implement idempotency for task execution
  - Add distributed tracing setup

recommendations:
  must_fix:
    - Implement state persistence layer with PostgreSQL snapshots
    - Add Saga pattern for distributed transactions
    - Define leader election and failover strategy
    - Create idempotency keys for task deduplication
    
  should_consider:
    - Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
    - Implement SLI/SLO monitoring dashboards
    - Create operational runbooks
    - Add contract testing for agent protocol
    - Implement bulkhead pattern for fault isolation
    
  nice_to_have:
    - Agent performance profiling system
    - Predictive scaling based on patterns
    - A/B testing framework for algorithms
    - GraphQL API alternative to REST

estimated_effort:
  state_persistence: 3-4 hours
  distributed_hardening: 2-3 hours
  enhanced_testing: 2 hours
  total_additional: 7-9 hours

test_strategy:
  phase_1: Component isolation and unit tests
  phase_2: Integration with S0-1.1 database schema
  phase_3: Multi-agent coordination scenarios
  phase_4: Failure mode and chaos engineering
  phase_5: Performance and scalability benchmarks
  phase_6: 72-hour soak test under load

quality_metrics:
  code_coverage_target: 85%
  critical_path_coverage: 100%
  performance_target: <100ms task assignment
  availability_target: 99.9%
  recovery_time_objective: <5 minutes
  recovery_point_objective: <1 minute

notes: |
  The story shows excellent architectural thinking and covers most orchestration
  concerns. The main gaps are around production hardening and distributed system
  edge cases. With the recommended additions, this would be a robust foundation
  for the agent orchestration system. Consider implementing in phases with the
  basic lifecycle management first, then adding advanced features.
