## Parallel Work Breakdown

### ðŸŸ¢ WEEK 1 - CRITICAL PATH CLEARING

**Monday (Day 1)**
```
Team A: SEC-001 (4hrs) â†’ SEC-002 (start)
Team B: FE-004 (6hrs) + FE-005 (start)
Team C: BE-004 (6hrs) + DB-001 (start)
Team D: TEST-001 (start integration framework)
```

**Tuesday (Day 2)**
```
Team A: SEC-002 (complete) â†’ SEC-003
Team B: FE-005 (complete) â†’ ACSS-001
Team C: DB-001 (complete) â†’ FF-001 (start)
Team D: TEST-001 (continue)
```

**Wednesday (Day 3)**
```
Team A: SEC-003 + SEC-004 â†’ DONE with security
Team B: ACSS-001 â†’ FE-001 (now unblocked!)
Team C: FF-001 (continue feature flags)
Team D: TEST-001 + PERF-001
```

**Thursday-Friday (Day 4-5)**
```
All teams work on unblocked features
Integration testing begins
Performance validation
```

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Communication Protocol
- 9 AM: Daily standup focusing on blockers
- 2 PM: SEC-001 status check (Day 1 only)
- 5 PM: End-of-day progress sync

### 2. Definition of Done
Each task must have:
- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests written
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in existing features

### 3. Risk Mitigation Triggers
If SEC-001 takes > 6 hours:
- Escalate to architect
- Consider temporary workaround
- Reallocate Team C to assist

If any task blocks > 2 days:
- Technical spike session
- Consider scope reduction
- Document as technical debt

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Daily Velocity Tracking
| Day | Planned Points | Actual Points | Blockers |
|-----|---------------|---------------|----------|
| 1   | 24            | TBD           | SEC-001  |
| 2   | 32            | TBD           | None     |
| 3   | 40            | TBD           | None     |
| 4   | 36            | TBD           | None     |
| 5   | 28            | TBD           | None     |

### Success Metrics
- SEC-001 fixed within 6 hours âœ…
- 50% of tasks started by Day 2 âœ…
- Zero security vulnerabilities in scan âœ…
- All P0 tasks complete by Day 3 âœ…
- Integration tests covering 80% by Day 5 âœ…

## Contingency Plans

### If SEC-001 Delayed
1. Implement temporary IP whitelist
2. Use basic auth as stopgap
3. Deploy to isolated environment
4. Continue parallel work on non-dependent tasks

### If Database Migration Fails
1. Use feature flags to disable new features
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Blue-green deployment with instant rollback
4. Keep old schema until migration validated

## Resource Requirements
- 4 developers (1 senior, 3 mid-level)
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 QA engineer
- Total: 6 people for 5 days = 240 person-hours
