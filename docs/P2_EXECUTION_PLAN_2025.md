## 🚦 Success Criteria for P2 Gate

### Must Pass All:
- [ ] 100% of API routes protected with JWT authentication
- [ ] Database query performance <100ms for 95% of queries
- [ ] Frontend fully integrated with authentication system
- [ ] RBAC implemented with at least 3 role types
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard operational with key metrics
- [ ] Redis caching reducing API response time by 40%
- [ ] Mobile responsive on all major breakpoints
- [ ] GDPR compliance checklist 80% complete
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] All P2 tests passing (target: 2,500+ tests)

## 🎯 Resource Allocation

### Team Structure:
```yaml
Backend Team (2 engineers):
  - Lead: SEC-005, SEC-006, AUDIT-001
  - Support: DB-002, PERF-005, CACHE-001

Frontend Team (2 engineers):
  - Lead: FE-006, FE-007, FE-008
  - Support: FE-009, UI testing

DevOps (1 engineer):
  - MON-002, deployment support, CI/CD maintenance

Compliance (1 specialist):
  - COMP-001, documentation, audit support

QA (1 engineer):
  - Continuous testing, regression prevention
```

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **JWT Coverage Extension** - Could break existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Rollback plan: Revert to current 40% coverage

2. **Database Optimization** - May cause data inconsistencies
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment with validation
   - Rollback plan: Instant switch to original DB config

3. **RBAC Implementation** - Complex permission matrix
   - Mitigation: Start with simple 3-role model
   - Rollback plan: Fall back to current auth model

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Daily Metrics:
- Tasks started vs completed
- Test coverage percentage
- API response time P95
- Security scan results
- Bug discovery rate

### Escalation Triggers:
- Any task >50% over estimated time
- Test coverage drops below 80%
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Performance regression >20%
- Team member unavailable

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### Every Commit Must:
1. Pass all existing tests
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation
4. Pass security scanning
5. Maintain or improve performance metrics

## 📝 Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups:
- 9:00 AM: Team sync (15 min)
- 2:00 PM: Progress check (5 min)
- 5:00 PM: End-of-day status (10 min)

### Escalation Path:
1. Task Owner → Team Lead (immediate)
2. Team Lead → Project Manager (within 2 hours)
3. Project Manager → Stakeholders (within 4 hours)

## ✅ P2 Completion Checklist

Before declaring P2 complete:
