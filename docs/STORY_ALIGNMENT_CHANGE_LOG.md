# Story Alignment Change Log

## Change Date: 2025-01-09
## Change Type: Story Numbering System Realignment
## Executed By: Bob (Scrum Master)

## Problem Summary
A critical discrepancy was discovered between development stories and QA expectations:
- Development had stories numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 for infrastructure fixes
- Sprint-0 Backlog had different stories with the same numbers for agentic features
- QA expected to review Story 1.4 (WebSocket) which didn't exist in current sprint

## Root Cause
Multiple parallel story numbering systems were active without coordination:
1. Day 1 fix stories (auth, directory, environment)
2. Sprint-0 backlog stories (agentic features)
3. Epic stories referenced by QA (from different planning document)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. File Renames
```bash
# Old → New
day1-story-1-1-fix-auth-tests.md → day1-fix-1-auth-tests.md
day1-story-1-2-resolve-directory.md → day1-fix-2-directory-resolution.md
day1-story-1-3-configure-environment.md → day1-fix-3-environment-config.md
```

### 2. Sprint-0 Backlog Updates
All stories now have S0- prefix:
- Story 1.1 → Story S0-1.1 (Agentic Database Schema)
- Story 1.2 → Story S0-1.2 (Agent Orchestrator Foundation)
- Story 1.3 → Story S0-1.3 (Conversational UI Foundation)
- Story 2.1 → Story S0-2.1 (Trust Level 0 Agent PoC)
- Story 2.2 → Story S0-2.2 (RAG Self-Critic PoC)
- Story 2.3 → Story S0-2.3 (Trust Progression Algorithm PoC)
- Story 3.1 → Story S0-3.1 (Agentic Monitoring Dashboard)
- Story 3.2 → Story S0-3.2 (Load Testing for Conversational UI)
- Story 3.3 → Story S0-3.3 (Security Audit Preparation)
- Story 4.1 → Story S0-4.1 (End-to-End Conversation Flow)
- Story 4.2 → Story S0-4.2 (Migration Strategy for Existing Users)

### 3. New Files Created
- `/docs/stories/STORY_INDEX.md` - Central tracking for all stories
- `/docs/STORY_ALIGNMENT_CHANGE_LOG.md` - This document

## New Numbering Convention

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Day Fixes | `day{n}-fix-{seq}` | day1-fix-1 |
| Sprint-0 | `S0-{epic}.{story}` | S0-1.1 |
| Features | `F-{epic}.{story}` | F-1.1 |
| Bugs | `BUG-{number}` | BUG-001 |
| Tech Debt | `TD-{number}` | TD-001 |

## Agent Handoff Requirements

### For QA Agent (Quinn)
- Review stories using new numbering system
- Check STORY_INDEX.md before reviewing
- Story 1.4 WebSocket needs to be created if required

### For Dev Agents
- Update any code comments referencing old story numbers
- Use new prefixes in future commits

### For PO Agent
- Maintain STORY_INDEX.md going forward
- Ensure all new stories follow naming convention

### For PM Agent
- Review if fundamental epic restructuring is needed
- Clarify which planning document is authoritative

## Success Metrics
✅ No duplicate story numbers
✅ Clear tracking index exists
✅ All files renamed consistently
✅ Sprint-0 backlog updated
✅ Documentation created

## Next Actions
1. All agents to review STORY_INDEX.md
2. QA to re-review against correct stories
3. Create Story 1.4 if WebSocket is needed for current sprint
4. Update story templates with prefix requirements

## Lessons Learned
- Multiple numbering systems cause confusion
- Central tracking index is essential
- Prefixes prevent conflicts
- Clear communication between agents is critical
