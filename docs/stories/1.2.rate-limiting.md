## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-orm]
- **Redis**: Version 7.0+ for rate limit storage
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis with connection pooling

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#middleware]
- **Middleware Location**: `/middleware/` directory
- **Config Location**: `/config/` directory
- **Monitoring**: Integration with Prometheus/Grafana

### Rate Limiting Strategy
Based on industry best practices:
- **Algorithm**: Sliding window with Redis sorted sets
- **Default Limits**:
  - Anonymous: 10 requests/minute
  - Authenticated: 100 requests/minute
  - Premium: 1000 requests/minute
  - Enterprise: 10000 requests/minute

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Rate limiter middleware: `/middleware/rate_limiter.py` (new)
- Rate limit config: `/config/rate_limits.py` (new)
- Redis service: `/services/redis_service.py` (enhance existing)
- Tests: `/tests/test_rate_limiting.py` (new)
- Monitoring config: `/monitoring/rate_limit_alerts.yml` (new)

### Configuration Schema
```python
# /config/rate_limits.py
RATE_LIMITS = {
    "default": {
        "anonymous": {"requests": 10, "window": 60},
        "authenticated": {"requests": 100, "window": 60},
        "premium": {"requests": 1000, "window": 60},
        "enterprise": {"requests": 10000, "window": 60}
    },
    "endpoints": {
        "/api/auth/login": {"requests": 5, "window": 300},  # Stricter for auth
        "/api/reports/generate": {"requests": 10, "window": 3600},  # Expensive operation
    }
}
```

### Redis Implementation Details
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-orm]
- Use Redis sorted sets for sliding window
- Key format: `rate_limit:{endpoint}:{user_id}:{window}`
- TTL set to window size for automatic cleanup
- Connection pooling for performance

### Integration Points
- Must work with JWT middleware from Story 1.1
- Feature flag integration for gradual rollout
- Monitoring integration with existing Prometheus setup
- Must not impact performance (target <5ms overhead)

### Error Response Format
```json
{
    "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please retry after 30 seconds.",
    "retry_after": 30,
    "limit": 100,
    "remaining": 0,
    "reset": 1704067200
}
```

## Testing
- Test file location: `/tests/test_rate_limiting.py`
- Test framework: pytest with asyncio and Redis mock
- Load testing with locust for performance validation
- Test different user tiers and endpoints
- Test Redis failure scenarios
- Verify rate limit headers

### Story Architecture Assessment

Comprehensive rate limiting implementation that provides multi-layered protection against abuse. The tiered approach with Redis-backed distributed limiting is industry best practice.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Critical for system availability and DDoS protection
- Security Impact: 9/10 (DDoS and abuse prevention)
- Performance Impact: 7/10 (adds overhead to every request)
- Availability Impact: 10/10 (prevents resource exhaustion)

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- AC1 (Rate limiting on all endpoints) → Task 1 ✓
- AC2 (Different limits for auth/anon) → Task 2 ✓
- AC3 (Configurable per endpoint/tier) → Task 2 ✓
- AC4 (429 error messages) → Task 7 ✓
- AC5 (Rate limit headers) → Task 3 ✓
- AC6 (Redis-based distributed) → Task 4 ✓
- AC7 (Admin bypass) → Task 5 ✓
- AC8 (Monitoring and alerting) → Task 6 ✓

### Technical Review

**Strengths:**
1. Sliding window algorithm (accurate rate limiting)
2. Tiered limits (anonymous/free/premium/enterprise)
3. Redis-backed for distributed systems
4. Admin bypass with audit logging
5. Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

**Areas for Enhancement:**
1. Burst allowance not addressed (consider token bucket addition)
2. IP-based vs user-based limiting strategy unclear
3. Cost-based limiting for expensive operations not detailed
4. Rate limit configuration hot-reload not mentioned

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security:** STRONG
- Protection against DDoS ✓
- Admin bypass with audit ✓
- Per-tier limiting ✓
- Missing: IP reputation scoring integration

**Performance:** GOOD
- Redis connection pooling ✓
- <5ms overhead target implicit
- Missing: Local cache for hot paths

**Reliability:** EXCELLENT
- Graceful Redis failure handling ✓
- Distributed counting ✓
- Missing: Circuit breaker for Redis

**Maintainability:** GOOD
- Environment-specific configs ✓
- Clear tier definitions ✓
- Monitoring dashboards ✓

### Test Architecture Assessment

Testing strategy covers:
- Unit tests for rate limit logic ✓
- Integration tests with Redis ✓
- Load tests for performance ✓
- Different user tier tests ✓
- Missing: Concurrent request testing

### Implementation Risks

1. **Redis dependency**: Single point of failure if Redis unavailable
2. **Configuration complexity**: Many endpoints × tiers = complex config
3. **Monitoring overhead**: High-volume metrics generation

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Before Implementation):**
1. Define fallback strategy when Redis unavailable (fail open/closed?)
2. Add burst allowance for legitimate traffic spikes
3. Clarify IP-based vs authenticated user limiting
4. Add configuration validation on startup

**Future Considerations:**
1. Implement adaptive rate limiting based on system load
2. Add IP reputation scoring integration
3. Consider cost-based limiting for expensive operations
4. Implement rate limit configuration hot-reload

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-rate-limiting.yml

Well-designed rate limiting story with comprehensive protection mechanisms. Redis failure strategy should be clarified.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Development] - Proceed with Redis failure strategy defined
