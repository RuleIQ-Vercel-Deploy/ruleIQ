# Story 1.1: JWT Validation Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] JWT tokens are validated on every protected endpoint
2. [ ] Token expiry is properly checked with appropriate error messages
3. [ ] Refresh token mechanism allows session extension without re-login

- [ ] Task 7: Create comprehensive tests (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Unit tests for token validation
  - [ ] Integration tests for refresh flow
  - [ ] Performance tests for validation speed
  - [ ] Security tests for edge cases

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication-security]
- **JWT Library**: python-jose 3.3.0+ for token handling
- **Password Hashing**: passlib 1.7.4+ with bcrypt 4.0.0+
- **Caching**: Redis 7.0+ for session storage and token blacklisting
- **Secrets Management**: python-dotenv for local, Doppler for production

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#middleware]
- **JWT Middleware Location**: `/middleware/jwt_auth_v2.py` (already created in SEC-001)
- **JWT Decorators**: `/middleware/jwt_decorators.py`
- **Auth Dependencies**: `/api/dependencies/auth.py`
- **Auth Router**: `/api/routers/auth.py`

### Existing Implementation Notes
From SEC-001 implementation (`/middleware/jwt_auth_v2.py`):
- JWTAuthMiddlewareV2 class already created with basic validation
- Public path patterns defined (docs, health, auth endpoints)
- Feature flag integration already present
- Basic token extraction and validation in place

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Token validation enhancements: `/middleware/jwt_auth_v2.py`
- Refresh token logic: `/api/routers/auth.py`
- Token blacklist service: `/services/token_blacklist_service.py` (new)
- Auth dependencies: `/api/dependencies/auth.py`
- Feature flag config: `/config/feature_flags.py`
- Tests: `/tests/test_jwt_validation.py` (new)

### Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#configuration]
- Use environment variables for JWT secrets
- Token expiry times should be configurable
- Feature flag percentages in config
- Redis connection pooling for performance

### Security Considerations
- JWT secret key must be at least 256 bits
- Refresh tokens should have longer expiry than access tokens
- Token rotation on refresh for security
- Rate limiting on refresh endpoint
- Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing]
- Unit tests required for all validation functions
- Integration tests for full auth flow
- Performance benchmarks for <10ms target
- Security tests for token manipulation attempts

## Testing
- Test file location: `/tests/test_jwt_validation.py`
- Test framework: pytest with asyncio support
- Mock Redis for unit tests
- Use test fixtures for token generation
- Performance testing with locust or similar
- Security testing for token tampering

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Story Architecture Assessment

This story is well-structured with comprehensive JWT validation requirements that build upon the SEC-001 foundation. The 8 acceptance criteria cover all critical aspects of JWT security.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Authentication is a critical security component
- Security Impact: 10/10 (authentication bypass risks)
- Performance Impact: 8/10 (every request affected)
- User Impact: 9/10 (session management critical)

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- AC1 (JWT validation on all endpoints) → Task 1 ✓
- AC2 (Token expiry checks) → Task 1 ✓
- AC3 (Refresh token mechanism) → Task 2 ✓
- AC4 (Token blacklisting) → Task 3 ✓
- AC5 (Performance <10ms) → Task 4 ✓
- AC6 (Feature flag integration) → Task 5 ✓
- AC7 (Comprehensive logging) → Task 6 ✓
- AC8 (95% test coverage) → Task 7 ✓

### Technical Review

**Strengths:**
1. Builds on existing jwt_auth_v2.py from SEC-001
2. Clear separation of concerns with dedicated services
3. Performance target explicitly defined (<10ms)
4. Security-first approach with token rotation
5. Comprehensive test coverage requirement (95%)

**Areas for Enhancement:**
1. Consider adding rate limiting on refresh endpoint (mentioned in notes but not in tasks)
2. Token storage strategy (httpOnly cookies) should be explicit task
3. Consider adding metrics for token validation performance
4. JWT secret rotation strategy not addressed

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security:** STRONG
- Token rotation on refresh ✓
- Blacklisting mechanism ✓
- 256-bit key requirement ✓
- Missing: JWT secret rotation strategy

**Performance:** WELL-DEFINED
- <10ms target specified ✓
- Redis caching planned ✓
- Connection pooling mentioned ✓

**Reliability:** ADEQUATE
- Fallback to v1 planned ✓
- Redis failure handling needed
- Token validation error handling covered

**Maintainability:** GOOD
- Clear file structure ✓
- Comprehensive logging ✓
- Feature flag for rollout ✓

### Test Architecture Assessment

The testing strategy is comprehensive:
- Unit tests for validation logic ✓
- Integration tests for refresh flow ✓
- Performance tests for <10ms target ✓
- Security tests for edge cases ✓
- Missing: Chaos testing for Redis failures

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Before Implementation):**
1. Add explicit task for httpOnly cookie implementation
2. Add rate limiting task for refresh endpoint
3. Define Redis failure fallback strategy
4. Add JWT secret rotation mechanism

**Future Considerations:**
1. Consider implementing token fingerprinting for additional security
2. Add monitoring dashboard for auth metrics
3. Consider implementing device-specific tokens
4. Plan for JWT algorithm migration strategy

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-jwt-validation.yml

The story is well-architected with clear requirements and comprehensive coverage. Minor enhancements recommended but not blocking.
