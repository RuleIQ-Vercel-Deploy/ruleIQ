## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-stack]
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.0+ running on separate port/domain
- **API Communication**: RESTful with WebSocket support
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens in headers/cookies

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#middleware]
- **Middleware Location**: `/middleware/` directory
- **Config Location**: `/config/` directory
- **Main App**: `/main.py` for middleware registration

### CORS Configuration Requirements
Based on FastAPI and security best practices:

```python
# Development Configuration
CORS_ORIGINS_DEV = [
    "http://localhost:3000",      # Next.js dev server
    "http://localhost:3001",      # Alternative port
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
]

# Production Configuration  
CORS_ORIGINS_PROD = [
    "https://app.ruleiq.com",
    "https://www.ruleiq.com",
]

# Headers Configuration
CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS = [
    "Authorization",
    "Content-Type",
    "X-Request-ID",
    "X-CSRF-Token",
]

CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS = [
    "X-Total-Count",
    "X-Page-Count",
    "X-RateLimit-Limit",
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining",
    "X-RateLimit-Reset",
]
```

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- CORS middleware: `/middleware/cors_config.py` (new)
- CORS settings: `/config/cors.py` (new)
- Environment config: Update `/config/settings.py`
- Main app integration: Update `/main.py`
- Tests: `/tests/test_cors.py` (new)

### FastAPI Integration
```python
# main.py integration example
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from config.cors import get_cors_config

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=get_cors_config()["origins"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    allow_headers=get_cors_config()["headers"],
    expose_headers=get_cors_config()["expose_headers"],
    max_age=3600,  # 1 hour preflight cache
)
```

### Environment Variables
Required in `.env`:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"]
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=true
CORS_MAX_AGE=3600
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Security Considerations
- Never use `allow_origins=["*"]` in production
- Validate Origin header against whitelist
- Use HTTPS in production
- Consider implementing CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Log and monitor CORS violations

### Integration with Other Middleware
- Must work with JWT authentication (Story 1.1)
- Must work with rate limiting (Story 1.2)
- Order matters: CORS should be early in middleware stack
- Should not interfere with health check endpoints

### Common CORS Issues to Handle
1. Preflight requests for complex HTTP methods
2. Credentials with cross-origin requests
3. WebSocket CORS configuration
4. File upload CORS headers
5. Streaming response headers

## Testing
- Test file location: `/tests/test_cors.py`
- Test framework: pytest with FastAPI test client
- Test scenarios:
  - Valid origins accepted
  - Invalid origins rejected
  - Preflight requests handled
  - Credentials work correctly
  - Headers properly exposed
- Browser testing with actual frontend
- Security testing for origin spoofing

### Story Architecture Assessment

Well-structured CORS configuration story that addresses cross-origin security properly. The focus on environment-specific configuration and security best practices is excellent.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM** - Important for frontend-backend communication
- Security Impact: 7/10 (cross-origin attack prevention)
- Functionality Impact: 10/10 (frontend won't work without proper CORS)
- Complexity: 4/10 (straightforward implementation)

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- AC1 (CORS on all endpoints) → Task 1 ✓
- AC2 (Configurable origins) → Task 2 ✓
- AC3 (Preflight handling) → Task 3 ✓
- AC4 (Credentials support) → Task 4 ✓
- AC5 (Exposed headers) → Task 5 ✓
- AC6 (Environment-specific) → Task 2 ✓
- AC7 (Security best practices) → Task 6 ✓
- AC8 (Error logging) → Task 7 ✓

### Technical Review

**Strengths:**
1. Clear separation of dev/staging/prod configurations
2. No wildcards in production (security best practice)
3. Comprehensive header exposure (pagination, rate limits)
4. Preflight caching (1 hour max age)
5. Integration considerations with other middleware

**Areas for Enhancement:**
1. WebSocket CORS not explicitly addressed
2. Vary header configuration not mentioned
3. Origin validation timing attacks mitigation missing
4. CORS policy versioning for migrations not considered

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security:** EXCELLENT
- No wildcard in production ✓
- Origin whitelist validation ✓
- Credentials handling ✓
- Missing: Timing attack mitigation

**Performance:** GOOD
- Preflight caching (1 hour) ✓
- Early middleware positioning ✓
- Missing: Origin validation caching

**Reliability:** GOOD
- Environment-specific configs ✓
- Error logging ✓
- Missing: Configuration validation tests

**Maintainability:** EXCELLENT
- Clear configuration structure ✓
- Environment variables ✓
- Comprehensive logging ✓

### Test Architecture Assessment

Testing approach includes:
- Unit tests for CORS logic ✓
- Integration tests with frontend ✓
- Different origin scenarios ✓
- Security tests ✓
- Missing: WebSocket CORS testing

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Middleware Order**: CORS must be early in stack (confirmed in notes)
2. **Cookie Handling**: SameSite attributes need coordination
3. **WebSocket Support**: May need additional configuration
4. **Health Endpoints**: Should remain CORS-free

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Before Implementation):**
1. Add WebSocket CORS configuration task
2. Include Vary: Origin header configuration
3. Add origin validation performance considerations
4. Document CORS policy migration strategy

**Future Considerations:**
1. Implement CORS policy versioning
2. Add origin validation caching for performance
3. Consider implementing CORS proxy for complex scenarios
4. Add CORS configuration validation endpoint

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-cors-configuration.yml

Solid CORS implementation plan with good security practices. WebSocket CORS should be addressed.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Development] - Story is well-defined and can proceed
