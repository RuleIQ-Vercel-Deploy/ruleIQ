# Story S0-2.3: Trust Progression Algorithm PoC

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** an intelligent algorithm that tracks user interaction patterns and automatically adjusts trust levels,
**so that** users can progressively gain more autonomy as they demonstrate competence and safe behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Tracks user interaction patterns and success rates
2. [ ] Calculates trust progression scores
3. [ ] Supports manual trust level overrides
4. [ ] Provides clear audit trail for trust decisions
5. [ ] Handles edge cases (user regression, suspicious behavior)
6. [ ] Implements trust level promotion thresholds
7. [ ] Prevents trust level gaming/manipulation
8. [ ] Supports trust level demotion for violations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design trust scoring algorithm (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `services/agents/trust_algorithm.py`
  - [ ] Define behavioral metrics:
    - [ ] Approval rate (actions approved vs rejected)
    - [ ] Error rate (failed actions after approval)
    - [ ] Consistency score (similar decisions over time)
    - [ ] Complexity handling (simple vs complex tasks)
  - [ ] Implement weighted scoring system
  - [ ] Add time-decay for old behaviors (90-day window)

- [ ] Implement behavior tracking system (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `models/trust_metrics.py` data model
  - [ ] Track per-session metrics:
    - [ ] Actions suggested
    - [ ] Actions approved/rejected
    - [ ] Execution outcomes
    - [ ] Time to decision
  - [ ] Store in PostgreSQL with indexes
  - [ ] Create Redis cache for real-time scoring

- [ ] Create trust level transition logic (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Define promotion thresholds:
    - [ ] L0→L1: 100 successful actions, 90% approval rate, 30 days active
    - [ ] L1→L2: 500 successful actions, 95% approval rate, 60 days active
    - [ ] L2→L3: 1000 successful actions, 98% approval rate, 90 days active
  - [ ] Implement cooldown periods between promotions (7 days)
  - [ ] Add promotion notification system
  - [ ] Create promotion approval workflow for L2→L3

- [ ] Build manual override system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create admin API endpoints in `api/v1/trust/overrides.py`
  - [ ] Implement override authorization (admin-only)
  - [ ] Add override reason tracking
  - [ ] Create override expiration mechanism
  - [ ] Log all overrides with justification

- [ ] Implement audit logging system (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `models/trust_audit.py` schema
  - [ ] Log all trust level changes:
    - [ ] Timestamp, user, old level, new level
    - [ ] Triggering metrics snapshot
    - [ ] Decision rationale
    - [ ] Override information if applicable
  - [ ] Integrate with compliance reporting
  - [ ] Create audit trail API endpoints

- [ ] Handle edge cases and violations (AC: 5, 8)
  - [ ] Implement anomaly detection:
    - [ ] Sudden behavior changes
    - [ ] Unusual action patterns
    - [ ] Rapid-fire approvals
  - [ ] Create demotion triggers:
    - [ ] Critical errors (3 strikes rule)
    - [ ] Security violations (immediate demotion)
    - [ ] Extended inactivity (90 days)
  - [ ] Add user regression handling
  - [ ] Implement trust freeze for investigation

- [ ] Prevent gaming and manipulation (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Detect artificial pattern creation
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting on actions
  - [ ] Add randomized verification checks
  - [ ] Monitor for automation/scripting
  - [ ] Create honeypot actions for detection

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for scoring algorithms
  - [ ] Integration tests for state transitions
  - [ ] Edge case scenario testing
  - [ ] Performance tests for real-time scoring
  - [ ] Security tests for manipulation attempts

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Information

**Trust Level System** [Source: S0-2.1 context]
- L0: Observed Mode - All actions require approval
- L1: Assisted Mode - Low-risk actions auto-approved
- L2: Supervised Mode - Most actions auto-approved
- L3: Autonomous Mode - Full autonomy with audit

**Database Models** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-orm]
- PostgreSQL 13+ for trust metrics storage
- Redis 7.0+ for real-time scoring cache
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ for ORM
- Time-series optimization for metrics

**Integration Points**
- Integrates with S0-2.1 L0 Agent for behavior tracking
- Uses Redis session storage from S0-1.2
- Connects to audit system from S0-2.1
- Feeds into monitoring dashboard (S0-3.1)

**Performance Requirements**
- Real-time scoring: <50ms calculation time
- Batch metric processing: Async via Celery
- Cache hit rate target: >95%
- Database query optimization with proper indexing

**Security Considerations**
- Trust scores encrypted at rest
- Rate limiting on trust API endpoints
- Admin actions require 2FA
- Audit logs immutable and signed

### Trust Scoring Formula
```python
trust_score = (
    0.40 * approval_rate +      # Weight: 40%
    0.30 * success_rate +        # Weight: 30%
    0.20 * consistency_score +   # Weight: 20%
    0.10 * complexity_score      # Weight: 10%
) * time_decay_factor
```

### State Transition Rules
```python
TRUST_LEVELS = {
    0: {"min_score": 0, "min_actions": 0, "min_days": 0},
    1: {"min_score": 70, "min_actions": 100, "min_days": 30},
    2: {"min_score": 85, "min_actions": 500, "min_days": 60},
    3: {"min_score": 95, "min_actions": 1000, "min_days": 90}
}
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing]
- Test files location: `tests/services/test_trust_algorithm.py`
- Use pytest framework with fixtures
- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- Mock Redis and database for unit tests
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async test cases

### Previous Story Context
From S0-2.1 (Trust Level 0 Agent):
- Approval workflow already implemented
- Risk assessment system available
- Audit logging infrastructure in place
- Performance metrics collection ready

From S0-2.2 (RAG Self-Critic):
- Confidence scoring patterns available
- Validation audit logs can be incorporated
- Circuit breaker patterns for protection
