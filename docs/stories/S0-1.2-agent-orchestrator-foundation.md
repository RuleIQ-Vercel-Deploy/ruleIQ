## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Service Layer Pattern**: All orchestration logic lives in `/services/agents/` following the existing service-oriented architecture pattern established in the RuleIQ codebase.

**Database Integration**: 
- Use SQLAlchemy models from `/models/agentic_models.py` created in S0-1.1
- Repository pattern via `/database/repositories/agentic_repository.py`
- Note: BaseRepository needs to be created for full repository pattern

**Existing Patterns to Follow**:
```python
# Service pattern from existing codebase
class ServiceName:
    def __init__(self, db_session: Session):
        self.db = db_session
        self.repository = Repository(db_session)
    
    async def operation(self, params):
        # Business logic here
        pass
```

**Key Integration Points**:
- FastAPI routers in `/api/routers/`
- Middleware in `/api/middleware/` for authentication
- Existing Redis client in `/database/redis_client.py` for caching
- Celery workers in `/workers/` for async tasks

### Trust Level Progression Rules
```
L0 (Observed): All actions require approval
L1 (Assisted): Suggestions provided, user executes
L2 (Supervised): Execute with confirmation
L3 (Delegated): Execute, report significant decisions
L4 (Autonomous): Full autonomy within boundaries
```

**Progression Criteria**:
- Accuracy > 90% over last 10 decisions → Level up
- Critical error → Drop to L0
- User rejection rate > 20% → Level down
- Time-based degradation if inactive

### Resource Limits
```python
AGENT_LIMITS = {
    "max_concurrent_agents": 10,
    "max_session_duration": 3600,  # 1 hour
    "max_context_size": 100000,    # characters
    "max_decisions_per_session": 1000,
    "max_memory_per_agent": "512MB"
}
```

### Testing Standards
- Test files location: `/tests/unit/services/agents/test_*.py`
- Use pytest fixtures from `/tests/conftest.py`
- Mock database sessions using `pytest-mock`
- Async tests use `pytest-asyncio`
- Minimum coverage: 80% for orchestration code
- Integration tests in `/tests/integration/test_agent_orchestration.py`

### Error Handling Requirements
- Use existing `CustomException` classes from `/api/exceptions.py`
- Log all errors to structured logging system
- Implement circuit breaker for external service calls
- Graceful degradation when agents fail
- Always maintain audit trail even during failures

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Review S0-1.1 database models
   - Set up test fixtures for agent testing
   - Create base service structure

2. **Core Development**:
   - Implement services in order listed in tasks
   - Write unit tests alongside each service
   - Ensure database transactions are properly managed

3. **Integration Phase**:
   - Create API endpoints in `/api/routers/agents.py`
   - Add middleware for agent authentication
   - Integrate with existing monitoring

4. **Testing Phase**:
   - Unit tests for each service
   - Integration tests for orchestration flows
   - Performance tests for concurrent agents
   - Chaos testing for failure scenarios

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL with agentic schema (S0-1.1)
- Redis for session caching
- SQLAlchemy models
- FastAPI framework
- Celery for async processing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Implement caching and connection pooling
- **Concurrency Risk**: Use database locks and atomic operations
- **Memory Risk**: Implement agent resource limits
- **Security Risk**: Validate all agent actions against permissions

## Definition of Done
- [x] All 10 acceptance criteria met
- [x] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [x] Integration tests passing
- [x] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms for common operations)
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [x] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured

```bash
# Run unit tests
