# P3-3: Advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Epic**: Enterprise Features  
**Story ID**: ENT-003  
**Priority**: P3  
**Estimated Points**: 8  
**Assigned To**: Security Team  
**Sprint**: Q3 2025 Sprint 3  
**Status**: Backlog  

## User Story
As a compliance administrator,  
I need granular role-based access control with custom roles and permissions,  
So that I can precisely control what each team member can see and do within the platform based on their responsibilities.

## Technical Context
**Purpose**: Provide enterprise-grade access control with fine-grained permissions  
**Scope**: Custom roles, permission inheritance, resource-level permissions, audit trail  
**Integration**: Extends existing basic role system from P1  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Custom role creation and management
- [ ] Granular permission system (200+ permissions)
- [ ] Role hierarchy with inheritance
- [ ] Resource-level permissions (per assessment, policy, etc.)
- [ ] Time-based access control
- [ ] Delegation capabilities
- [ ] Permission templates for common roles
- [ ] Bulk role assignment
- [ ] Permission audit trail
- [ ] Role analytics dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Permission Model
```python
class PermissionSystem:
    """
    Hierarchical permission system with inheritance
    """
    
    # Permission Structure
    class Permission:
        resource: str      # "assessment", "policy", "user"
        action: str        # "create", "read", "update", "delete"
        scope: str         # "own", "team", "organization", "all"
        conditions: Dict   # Time-based, attribute-based conditions
        
    # Role Definition
    class Role:
        name: str
        description: str
        permissions: List[Permission]
        parent_role: Optional[Role]  # Inheritance
        is_system: bool              # Built-in vs custom
        constraints: Dict            # Max users, expiry, etc.
        
    # Permission Evaluation
    def can_perform(user, resource, action):
        # Check direct permissions
        # Check inherited permissions
        # Apply conditions and constraints
        # Log access decision
```

### Implementation Components

1. **Permission Engine**
   - Permission evaluation logic
   - Inheritance resolution
   - Condition checking
   - Caching layer

2. **Role Manager**
   - CRUD operations for roles
   - Template management
   - Validation rules
   - Migration tools

3. **Access Control Middleware**
   - Request interception
   - Permission checking
   - Audit logging
   - Performance optimization

4. **Admin Interface**
   - Role builder UI
   - Permission matrix
   - User assignment
   - Analytics dashboard

## Permission Categories
```yaml
Assessment Permissions:
  - assessment:create:own
  - assessment:read:team
  - assessment:update:own
  - assessment:delete:own
  - assessment:approve:team
  - assessment:export:all

Policy Permissions:
  - policy:create:organization
  - policy:read:all
  - policy:update:organization
  - policy:delete:organization
  - policy:publish:organization
  - policy:archive:organization

User Management:
  - user:create:organization
  - user:read:all
  - user:update:team
  - user:delete:organization
  - user:impersonate:support
  - user:audit:all

System Administration:
  - system:config:read
  - system:config:update
  - system:audit:read
  - system:integration:manage
  - system:backup:create
  - system:maintenance:perform
```

## Default Role Templates
```python
# Predefined roles for quick setup
ROLE_TEMPLATES = {
    "Compliance Officer": {
        "permissions": ["assessment:*", "policy:*", "evidence:*"],
        "description": "Full compliance management"
    },
    "Auditor": {
        "permissions": ["*:read:all", "assessment:comment", "evidence:download"],
        "description": "Read-only with comment ability"
    },
    "Team Lead": {
        "permissions": ["*:*:team", "user:create:team"],
        "description": "Full team management"
    },
    "Contributor": {
        "permissions": ["assessment:*:own", "evidence:upload:own"],
        "description": "Manage own assessments"
    },
    "Viewer": {
        "permissions": ["*:read:team"],
        "description": "Read-only team access"
    }
}
```

```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for permission evaluation
- Integration tests for inheritance
- Performance tests with 1000+ roles
- Security tests for privilege escalation
- UI/UX testing for role management

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Permission complexity | High | Template system + documentation |
| Performance impact | Medium | Caching + optimization |
| Privilege escalation | High | Audit trail + validation |
| Migration complexity | Medium | Automated migration tools |

## Dependencies
- Basic authentication (P0 - COMPLETE)
- User management (P1 - COMPLETE)
- Multi-tenant architecture (P3-1)
- Audit logging system
