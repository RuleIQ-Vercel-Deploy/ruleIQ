# Story 1.1: Fix Frontend Authentication Test Suite

## Story Details
**ID**: DEPLOY-001  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Blocker)  
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Assigned To**: Frontend Developer  
**Day**: 1 (Sept 9)  
**Status**: Ready for Development  

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer,  
I want all authentication-related tests passing,  
so that we have confidence in our authentication flows before deployment.

## Technical Context
**Current State**: 15-20 failing tests in the authentication module  
**Root Cause**: Mock data misalignment between frontend and backend API contracts  
**Files Involved**:
- `/frontend/tests/api/api-services.test.ts`
- `/frontend/tests/mocks/auth-setup.ts`
- `/frontend/lib/api/authentication.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests in `/frontend/tests/api/api-services.test.ts` pass without errors
- [ ] Mock data in `/frontend/tests/mocks/auth-setup.ts` aligns with actual API responses
- [ ] Authentication service methods return expected data structures
- [ ] Test coverage for auth module reaches 85%
- [ ] No console errors or warnings during test execution

## Implementation Steps
1. **Analyze Current Test Failures** (30 min)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test -- tests/api/api-services.test.ts --verbose
   ```
   - Document all failing test cases
   - Identify pattern in failures

2. **Update Mock Data Structure** (1.5 hours)
   - Compare mock responses with actual API documentation
   - Update `/frontend/tests/mocks/auth-setup.ts`:
     - JWT token structure
     - User object schema
     - Session response format
     - Error response structures

3. **Fix Test Implementations** (1.5 hours)
   - Remove duplicate imports (already identified)
   - Update test assertions to match new mock data
   - Fix async/await patterns where needed
   - Ensure proper test cleanup

4. **Validate Integration** (30 min)
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify no regression in other tests
   - Check test coverage report

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Existing login/logout flows continue working in development
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation remains functional
- [ ] Test execution time remains under 30 seconds
- [ ] No breaking changes to authentication API contracts

## Commands
```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/api/api-services.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage tests/api/

# Run in watch mode for development
npm test -- --watch tests/api/api-services.test.ts
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication tests passing (0 failures)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥ 85% for auth module
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Changes committed with descriptive message
- [ ] Documentation updated if API contracts changed

## Rollback Plan
If tests reveal deeper architectural issues:
1. Revert mock changes
2. Document discovered issues
3. Escalate to technical lead
4. Create separate technical debt story

## Notes
- Known issue: Duplicate `setupAuthMocks` imports already identified
- Consider extracting common test utilities if patterns emerge
- May need to update TypeScript interfaces if API contract changed
