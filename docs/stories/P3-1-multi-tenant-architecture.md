# P3-1: Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Epic**: Enterprise Features  
**Story ID**: ENT-001  
**Priority**: P3  
**Estimated Points**: 21  
**Assigned To**: Backend Architecture Team  
**Sprint**: Q3 2025 Sprint 1-2  
**Status**: Backlog  

## User Story
As an enterprise administrator,  
I need a multi-tenant architecture that isolates customer data and configurations,  
So that I can manage multiple organizations from a single platform instance while ensuring complete data isolation and security.

## Technical Context
**Purpose**: Enable enterprise customers to manage multiple subsidiaries/departments with isolated data  
**Scope**: Database isolation, tenant management, cross-tenant queries, billing segregation  
**Integration**: Extends existing user management with organization hierarchy  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete data isolation between tenants at database level
- [ ] Tenant-aware routing and middleware
- [ ] Cross-tenant admin capabilities for super-admins
- [ ] Tenant-specific configurations and customizations
- [ ] Isolated file storage per tenant
- [ ] Tenant-specific API rate limits
- [ ] Billing segregation per tenant
- [ ] Audit logging with tenant context
- [ ] Tenant provisioning automation
- [ ] Tenant data export/migration tools

## Technical Architecture

### Database Strategy
```python
class TenantIsolationStrategy:
    """
    Row-level security with tenant_id partitioning
    """
    
    # Option 1: Shared Database, Shared Schema (Row-level)
    class SharedSchema:
        - Add tenant_id to all tables
        - PostgreSQL RLS policies
        - Automatic tenant filtering
        - Lower cost, easier maintenance
        
    # Option 2: Shared Database, Separate Schema
    class SeparateSchema:
        - Schema per tenant
        - Complete isolation
        - Higher cost, complex migrations
        
    # Recommended: Hybrid approach
    class HybridApproach:
        - Shared tables for reference data
        - Tenant schemas for business data
        - Balanced isolation and efficiency
```

### Implementation Components
1. **Tenant Manager Service**
   - Tenant provisioning
   - Configuration management
   - Lifecycle management
   - Resource allocation

2. **Tenant Context Middleware**
   - Request tenant resolution
   - Tenant validation
   - Context injection
   - Cross-tenant authorization

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Automatic tenant filtering
   - Query modification
   - Connection routing
   - Cache isolation

4. **Tenant Admin Portal**
   - Tenant creation wizard
   - Configuration management
   - User assignment
   - Usage analytics

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for tenant isolation
- Integration tests for cross-tenant scenarios
- Performance tests with 100+ tenants
- Security penetration testing
- Data leak prevention validation

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data leakage between tenants | Critical | RLS policies + audit logging |
| Performance degradation | High | Indexing strategy + caching |
| Complex migrations | Medium | Automated migration tools |
| Increased operational complexity | Medium | Monitoring + automation |

## Dependencies
- Current authentication system (P0 - COMPLETE)
- User management system (P1 - COMPLETE)
- Database architecture review
- DevOps infrastructure updates

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Multi-tenant database schema implemented
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified through security testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 5% overhead)
- [ ] Admin portal for tenant management
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks created
- [ ] 100% test coverage for isolation logic
- [ ] Zero data leakage in penetration tests

## Estimated Effort Breakdown
- Database schema changes: 40 hours
- Middleware implementation: 24 hours
- Admin portal: 32 hours
- Testing and security validation: 40 hours
- Documentation and training: 8 hours
- **Total: 144 hours (21 story points)**
