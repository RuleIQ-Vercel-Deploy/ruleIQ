# RuleIQ Agent Architecture Analysis
## IQ Agent & Multi-Agent System Deep Dive
### Version 1.0 - January 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

RuleIQ implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture centered around **IQ** - the autonomous Chief Compliance Officer agent. The system combines GraphRAG intelligence, LangGraph orchestration, and specialized agent workflows to deliver autonomous compliance management. With the GraphRAG foundation complete, the agent system is positioned to evolve from helper to advisor to autonomous partner.

**Key Finding**: The IQ Agent is production-ready with 700+ lines of code, implementing the PPALE framework (Perceive, Plan, Act, Learn, rEmember) for continuous intelligence improvement.

## CONCLUSION

RuleIQ's agent architecture, centered around IQ as the autonomous Chief Compliance Officer, represents a paradigm shift in compliance management. The system successfully combines:

1. **GraphRAG Intelligence**: Deep compliance knowledge with multi-hop reasoning
2. **PPALE Framework**: Continuous learning and improvement
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents for different tasks
4. **Trust Gradient**: Evolution from helper to autonomous partner
5. **Memory Systems**: Context preservation and pattern learning

With the foundation complete and GraphRAG operational, the focus shifts to:
- Implementing conversational assessment (AI-002)
- Deploying hallucination prevention (AI-003)
- Enhancing agent autonomy
- Building user trust through transparent operations

The architecture positions RuleIQ to deliver unprecedented value through intelligent, autonomous compliance management that improves with every interaction.
