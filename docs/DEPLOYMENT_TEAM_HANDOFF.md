|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Test won't pass after 2 hours | Pair program | Team Lead |
| API contract mismatch | Schedule sync meeting | Backend + Frontend |
| Missing credentials | Check with DevOps | CTO |
| Build failures | Check CI/CD logs | DevOps Engineer |
| Import errors | Verify directory structure | Frontend Developer |

## Definition of "Done" for Day 1

A story is ONLY complete when:
1. All acceptance criteria met
2. Code reviewed by peer
3. Tests passing locally
4. Changes committed to branch
5. No regression in other areas
6. Documentation updated if needed

## Risk Awareness

### Known Risks
1. **Test failures may indicate deeper issues**
   - Mitigation: Time-boxed investigation (2 hours max)
   - Fallback: Document and create tech debt ticket

2. **Environment config may break integrations**
   - Mitigation: Test each service individually
   - Fallback: Use previous working configuration

3. **Directory restructure may break imports**
   - Mitigation: Full backup before changes
   - Fallback: Restore from backup

## Tools and Resources

### Monitoring Dashboards
- Build Status: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/org/ruleiq/actions)
- Error Tracking: Sentry Dashboard
- Performance: DataDog Metrics
