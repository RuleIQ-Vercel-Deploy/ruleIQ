# RuleIQ Production Deployment Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis combined with deployment readiness documentation
- Strategic deployment plan available at: `/home/omar/Documents/ruleIQ/STRATEGIC_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`
- Deployment readiness analysis at: `/home/omar/Documents/ruleIQ/DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_ANALYSIS.md`

#### Current Project State
RuleIQ is an AI-powered compliance automation platform for UK SMBs that has been in development for 18+ months. The system provides automated compliance assessments, gap analysis, and action plans through a sophisticated web application. Currently at 80% deployment readiness with robust backend infrastructure (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis), comprehensive CI/CD pipelines (20+ GitHub Actions workflows), and a feature-complete frontend (Next.js 15.4.7) requiring focused attention on test failures and configuration gaps.

### Available Documentation Analysis

#### Available Documentation
- [✓] Tech Stack Documentation (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [✓] Source Tree/Architecture (Monorepo structure documented)
- [✓] Coding Standards (CLAUDE.md comprehensive guidelines)
- [✓] API Documentation (FastAPI with auto-docs)
- [✓] External API Documentation (Google AI, OAuth integrations)
- [✓] UX/UI Guidelines (Tailwind CSS, component library)
- [✓] Technical Debt Documentation (15-20 failing tests identified)
- [✓] Deployment Documentation (docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- [✓] Bug Fix and Stability Improvements
- [✓] Integration with New Systems (Environment configuration)
- [✓] Performance/Scalability Improvements (Pre-production optimization)

#### Enhancement Description
This enhancement focuses on resolving the final 20% of deployment blockers to achieve production readiness within 5 days. Primary focus is fixing frontend test failures, completing environment configuration, and validating all integration points before launching to capture the growing UK SMB compliance market.

#### Impact Assessment
- [✓] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)
- Test fixes require updates to authentication service mocks
- Environment configuration impacts all service integrations
- Directory structure cleanup affects build processes

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Achieve 100% test pass rate across frontend and backend
- Complete environment configuration with all required API keys
- Validate end-to-end user flows for core functionality
- Deploy to staging environment with full validation
- Launch to production with < 1% error rate

#### Background Context
RuleIQ has reached a critical juncture where 18+ months of development work is ready for market launch. The UK SMB compliance market is experiencing 40% YoY growth with new regulations taking effect January 2025, creating a time-sensitive opportunity. The platform's core functionality is complete, but technical debt in the form of test failures and configuration gaps prevents confident deployment. This enhancement addresses these specific blockers through a structured 5-day sprint, ensuring quality while capturing first-mover advantage in the pre-compliance rush expected Q4 2024.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript, Python 3.11, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: Next.js 15.4.7, React 19, FastAPI, Tailwind CSS
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations, Redis for caching
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions CI/CD
**External Dependencies**: Google AI API, OAuth providers, SMTP services, Stripe payments

### Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: Use existing Alembic migration system for any schema updates, maintain backward compatibility
**API Integration Strategy**: Preserve all existing endpoint contracts, add versioning only if breaking changes required
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Fix tests within existing Vitest/Playwright framework, maintain component library
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing test suites rather than replacing, focus on fixing not rewriting

### Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: Maintain current monorepo structure, resolve frontend/frontend duplication
**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing CLAUDE.md standards for consistency
**Coding Standards**: Enforce via existing ESLint/Prettier configuration
**Documentation Standards**: Update existing docs in-place, maintain markdown format

### Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: Use existing GitHub Actions workflows, fix any failing steps
**Deployment Strategy**: Follow existing blue-green deployment pattern with staging validation
**Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate with existing Prometheus/logging infrastructure
**Configuration Management**: Use environment variables with .env files, secrets in GitHub

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: Test failures may indicate deeper architectural issues - Mitigate with incremental fixes and validation
**Integration Risks**: API contract mismatches between frontend/backend - Mitigate with contract testing
**Deployment Risks**: Production issues not caught in staging - Mitigate with comprehensive staging tests
**Mitigation Strategies**: Feature flags for risky components, staged rollout, comprehensive rollback plan

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic covering all deployment blockers with rationale: The enhancement represents a cohesive set of interdependent fixes required for deployment readiness. Breaking into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries and complicate coordination.

## Epic 1: Production Deployment Readiness Sprint

**Epic Goal**: Resolve all deployment blockers and achieve production readiness within 5 days through systematic test fixes, configuration completion, and validation

**Integration Requirements**: All changes must preserve existing functionality while fixing identified issues. Each story includes verification steps to ensure system integrity.
