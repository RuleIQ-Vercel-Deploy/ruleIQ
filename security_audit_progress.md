## In Progress ðŸ”„
- [ ] Infrastructure Security
- [ ] API Security Review
- [ ] Main Application Security Integration

## Findings So Far
### Strengths
- Comprehensive RBAC system with proper database models
- JWT token blacklisting implemented
- Enhanced authentication service with MFA support
- Password complexity validation
- Account lockout protection
- Audit logging framework in place

### Issues Identified
- SECRET_KEY fallback to random generation (should use Doppler)
- Password validation inconsistency between files
- Mixed sync/async patterns in auth dependencies

## Next Steps
- Continue with authorization service review
- Examine middleware stack
- Check encryption implementations
